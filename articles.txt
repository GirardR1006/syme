Web Mining Research: A Survey

Unstructured and semi-structured data: Bag of words, N-grams, etc.
Our usage: text classification / text categorization
Methods: TFIDF, NLP (statistical methods)
naive Bayes / Bayes trees || S. Dumais, J. Platt, D. Heckerman, and M. Sa-
hami. Inductive learning algorithms and representa-
tions for text categorization. In Proceedings of the 1998

Web structure mining (Information recovery)
mostly graph processing. Need to ask to some Operational Researcher


Needs to figure out solutions for data recovery AND data extraction:
    identify the most relevant sources (potentially with the help of Web structure mining) 
    extract from those sources the relevant chunks of data
    (process those chunks to partially convert them into Methode)
