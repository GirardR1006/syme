How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.\n\nRecommended Background:\nProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.

We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - \"Euthyphro\", \"Meno\", \"Republic\" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology. \n\nPlatonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher's mouth. You'll get a feel for it.\n\nWe have a book: the new 4th edition of \"Reason and Persuasion\", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don't worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.) \n\nThe book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.\n\nThe course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons. \n\nThe results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons. But there's no reason you can't skip over and around to find whatever seems most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.\n\nPlato has meant different things to different people. He's got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices. (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven't been before.

Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?\n\nEven within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements. \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Hugo Grotius, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, and more contemporary theorists such as Michelle Alexander, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Bryan Caplan, Angela Davis, Ronald Dworkin, Jon Elster, John Hart Ely, H.L.A.

It is now  available with subtitles, in English and now in Chinese.\n\nSee the  video  at http://goo.gl/YKSMnD","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"mechanical-engineering","domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering"},{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"id":"At1XBOAAEeWoTg63tTECEQ","slug":"fluid-solid-interaction","name":"Fundamentals of Fluid-Solid Interactions"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.\n\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"},{"subdomainId":"mobile-and-web-development","domainId":"computer-science"}],"id":"8om3I-4LEeSbxyIACw0OOQ","slug":"programming-languages","name":"Programming Languages, Part A"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course provides an unique opportunity for you to learn key components of text mining and analytics aided by the real world datasets and the text mining toolkit written in Java.

The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing\" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: \n(1) The excess burden of taxation\n(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax?\n(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve\n(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model\n(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing\nIf you haven't done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"DJfupMVPEeWLqBIulHpzDw","slug":"economic-growth-part-2","name":"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part II - Maximize Social Wellbeing"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Markets begins with one of the most common and important elements of the financial system – interest rates.  You will learn why interest rates have always been a key barometer in determining the value of everything.  You will explore the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of negative interest rates. Markets explains how interest rates change the value of all financial instruments, highlighting the role of the bond and stock markets that have toppled empires.  We take a closer look at the equity pricing models and equity markets that reverberate across the globe, and explore everything from the first stock ever issued – by the Dutch East India Company – to the little-understood but powerful derivative securities market.  By the end of the course, you will have developed insight into the intersections of the financial markets with worlds of policy, politics, and power. You will have demonstrated that insight by teaching an important financial concept and translating a financial product or transaction to someone who will clearly benefit from your advice.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"finance","domainId":"business"}],"id":"orCUF26dEeW8nw5ORrHGtQ","slug":"finance-markets","name":"Finance for Everyone: Markets"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Which are the deepest roots of that mix of cultures that we use to call ‘Mediterranean Civilization’?

Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.\n\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order.

Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.

We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present.

But “under the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.\n\nThe material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called \"Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. \n\nThe course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.\n\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\nDuke University\n www.duke.edu/~jmgroh\n\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled \"Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).\n\nMuch of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\n\nDr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\n\nDr. Groh’s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

It is meant to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the course, learners should be able to:\n\n•\tArticulate key public health concepts related to global health;\n•\tAnalyze the key issues in global health from a number of perspectives;\t\n•\tDiscuss with confidence the burden of disease in various regions of the world; how it varies by sex, age, and location; key risk factors for this burden; and how the disease burden can be addressed in cost-effective ways;\n•\tAssess key health disparities, especially as they relate to the health of low-income and marginalized people in low- and middle-income countries; \n•\tOutline the key actors and organizations in global health and the manner in which they cooperate to address critical global health concerns;\n•\tReview key global health challenges that are likely to arise in the coming decades.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nValue Added of the Course\n\nThe course seeks to add special value by being comprehensive, by handling each  topic in a consistent framework, and by helping learners gain an understanding of well grounded approaches to assessing global health issues and what can be done to address them.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health\n\nFor almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see: \n\n- Required readings\n- Recommended readings\n- Recommended videos\n\nWe have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.\n\nFor each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nIn addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session. \n\nThe first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.\n\nThe second set of “recommended readings” is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nLearners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.\n\nWe have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"nutrition","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"id":"LD8hNEdxEeaDoBKORUcroQ","slug":"essentials-global-health","name":"Essentials of Global Health"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"A menudo, nos referimos a la contabilidad financiera como «el lenguaje de los negocios», es decir, el lenguaje que los directivos utilizan para transmitir información financiera y económica sobre su empresa a aquellas partes externas a ella, como los accionistas y los acreedores.

The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.\n\nAs the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics.

This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic “realism” is and what it meant.\n\nLearners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as “sister arts” but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"fYdWi52JEeWIXgpWJNgyEw","slug":"visual-literary-culture-in-japan","name":"Words Spun Out of Images: Visual and Literary Culture in Nineteenth Century Japan"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"本课程是北京大学开设的一门在线大学化学基础课，主要面向具有大学水平的化学初学者。课程内容基本涵盖全部基础化学概念。","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"chemistry","domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering"}],"name":"大学化学","id":"5CCP4gWAEeWXaSIACyAJQw","slug":"da-xue-hua-xue"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Why just write poems when you can write better ones?

Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.\n\nPart 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’. \n\nPart 2 (this course) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\n\nCourse Overview video: https://youtu.be/dzUPRyJ4ETk","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"data-analysis","domainId":"data-science"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"CPLPuDKiEeaGtRI0HQleow","slug":"understanding-china-history-part-2","name":"Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach, Part 2"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course, you will learn the science behind how digital images and video are made, altered, stored, and used.

Les besoins sont immenses et la concurrence pour trouver des fonds n’a jamais été aussi vive. \n\nMalgré son importance, la philanthropie reste mal connue notamment en France et en Europe. Plusieurs questions clés restent en suspens : De quoi parle-t-on exactement ? Qu’est-ce qui motive les philanthropes et favorise leur action ? Quelles sont les différentes façons d’agir en philanthropie ? Quel est son impact et comment l’évaluer?

They require in addition the ability to collect, analyze and think about data. Personal life is enriched when these same skills are applied to problems in everyday life involving judgment and choice. This course presents basic concepts from statistics, probability, scientific methodology, cognitive psychology and cost-benefit theory and shows how they can be applied to everything from picking one product over another to critiquing media accounts of scientific research. Concepts are defined briefly and breezily and then applied to many examples drawn from business, the media and everyday life.\n\nWhat kinds of things will you learn? Why it’s usually a mistake to interview people for a job. Why it’s highly unlikely that, if your first meal in a new restaurant is excellent, you will find the next meal to be as good.

It is about doing research, analyzing primary sources, and connecting all this information with a coherent and logical interpretation. It is an invitation to think critically and historically, and it wants to give you a glimpse of what it means to be a historian at work. \n\nWe are convinced that the three Roosevelts – the 3Rs, as we will refer to them throughout this course – profoundly shaped the twentieth century. This course shows you why we think so and which paradigms, ideas, and sources we use to uphold our claim. But this course also asks you to give your opinion, and ground it on your own research findings. \n\nThe structure of the course is straightforward: \n- An introductory module gives you the biographical information you need to connect the personal stories of the 3Rs with the major events of the twentieth century;\n-  Module 2 explains how the 3Rs reframed our thinking on security, broadening its meaning and reconfiguring the government’s role in providing it; \n- Module 3, focusing on equality, shows how the 3Rs changed the relationship between leaders and led, rejected laissez-faire economics, and supported a politics of intervention to overcome the inequalities that undermined social cohesion;\n- Module 4 describes how the 3Rs promoted and protected the freedom of ordinary citizens, and communicated that as one of their central political goals;\n- Module 5 summarizes the long-lasting legacies of the 3Rs, and asks for your opinion on the Rooseveltian century. Do you agree with this interpretation of our recent past – and our possible futures?\n\nThe five modules contain quizzes to test your knowledge and understanding, discussion prompts to stimulate your creativity, and research guidance and assignments to sharpen up your historical skills. \n\nWe hope you will enjoy this intellectual journey!","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"PJg2NGKXEeWpHwqwM9Gg0w","slug":"roosevelt","name":"The Rooseveltian Century"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In \"Engaging in Persuasive and Credible Communication\", you will learn the key skill of persuasion, in the context of professional communication in a globalised world. \n\nPersuasive communication is essential to any professional workplace.

D’Aristote à Kant, de Bentham à Derrida, à travers un voyage philosophique passionnant nous entrerons dans le vif du débat éthique contemporain.\n\nNotre monde toujours plus complexe semble nous échapper. Réchauffement climatique, questions de début et de fin de vie, évolution vertigineuse des bio-technologies, inégale distribution des richesses, pressions migratoires accentuées… La tentation est grande d’une vie morale repliée sur elle-même à partir d’une éthique minimale : « fais ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en péril la liberté des autres ». Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied : défendre l’idée d’une éthique qui nous plonge dans notre réalité sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout réinventer.\nC’est pourquoi nous présentons un cours qui permet de se familiariser avec les plus importantes perspectives éthiques traversant le monde contemporain : l’éthique des vertus (ou perfectionnisme) ; l’éthique du devoir (ou déontologisme) ; l’éthique utilitariste (ou conséquentialisme) ; l’éthique de l’amour (ou éthique du don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l’ordre dans ses idées, repérer les différentes manières de s’orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les différences d’appréciation face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.\n\nQuels que soient votre champ de savoir académique, votre engagement professionnel ou vos choix personnels, il s’agit de proposer des clés d’analyse dont vous disposerez. Pour cela, nous alternerons tout au long de ce cours les présentations des grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but : clarifier les idées pour mieux comprendre le réel et mieux orienter l’action.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAbout this course:\n\nThis course presents the main schools of thought that frame today’s ethical reflection and affect everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant, from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: \"do what you want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others\". We propose to go against this trend and to defend the idea of ​​an ethics that immerses us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives. Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis. Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in order to better understand reality and orient human action.\n\n- - - - - - - - -- - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - -- \n善、正义、功用：哲学伦理学导论\n \n本课程旨在向大家介绍伦理学的主要流派，这些流派对如今的伦理思考意义非凡，并且涉及到每个人的个人生活、社会生活和公民生活。\n从亚里士多德到康德，从边沁到德里达，通过引人入胜的哲学之旅，我们将进入当代伦理学辩论的核心问题。","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"},{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"name":"Le Bien, le Juste, l'Utile.

Some of us like to count, others hate it, but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things, pay for services, estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbers’ properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said “The Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematics”. Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course, we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks. By the end, you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages, and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!\n\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity.

В 1736 году выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер заинтересовался задачей и в письме другу привел строгое доказательство того, что сделать это невозможно. В том же году он доказал замечательную формулу, которая связывает число вершин, граней и ребер многогранника в трехмерном пространстве. Формула таинственным образом верна и для графов, которые называются \"планарными\". Эти два результата заложили основу теории графов и неплохо иллюстрируют направление ее развития по сей день. \n\nГраф как математический объект оказался полезным во многих теоретических и практических задачах. Наверное, дело в том, что сложность его структуры хорошо отвечает возможностям нашего мозга: это структура наглядная и понятно устроенная, но, с другой стороны, достаточно богатая, чтобы улавливать многие нетривиальные явления. Если говорить о приложениях, то, конечно, сразу же на ум приходят большие сети: Интернет, карта дорог, покрытие мобильной связи и т.п. В основах поисковых машин, таких, как Yandex и Google, лежат алгоритмы на графах. Помимо computer science, графы активно используются в биоинформатике, химии, социологии.\n\nЭтот курс служит введением в современную теорию графов. Мы, конечно, обсудим классические задачи, но и поговорим про более недавние результаты и тенденции, например, про экстремальную теорию графов. \n\nМатериал изложен с самых основ и на доступном языке. Целью этого курса является не только познакомить вас с вопросами и методами теории графов, но и развить у неподготовленных слушателей культуру математического мышления. Поэтому курс доступен широкому кругу слушателей. Для освоения материала будет достаточно знания математики на хорошем школьном уровне и базовых знаний комбинаторики.\n\nКурс состоит из 7 учебных недель и экзамена. Для успешного решения большинства задач из тестов достаточно освоить материал, рассказанный на лекциях. На семинарах разбираются и более сложные задачи, которые смогут заинтересовать слушателя, уже знакомого с основами теории графов.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"},{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"computer-security-and-networks"}],"id":"SifJJ1fVEeWT8xIUiEQHHQ","slug":"teoriya-grafov","name":"Теория графов"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course will teach you the \"magic\" of getting deep learning to work well.

The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has resulted in numerous challenges and opportunities for contemporary cities and will continue to do so. This course will help you to understand how to make the best of these smart technologies in your cities’ legacy infrastructures.  \nOver the past few years, advances in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable land scape of urban infrastructure service provision. This has resulted in increasing interest from both technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so-called “Smart Cities”. Although such “Smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the Smart urban infrastructures, namely Smart urban transportation and Smart urban energy systems. Over the journey of this 5-week online course you will learn about the most important principles for the management of Smart urban infrastructures as well as the applications of these principles in the transportation and energy sectors. \nThis course does not have any prerequisites. However, to take the most away from of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our other MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures, which has been widely praised by learners. \nThrough this course, you will:\n- Gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure systems;\n- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies for effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart urban systems;\n- Study the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and\n- Understand potential applications of the materials learned in this course within the context of the management of smart urban transportation systems as well as smart urban energy systems.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"id":"AHvXwCwKEeaMjA6stS_New","slug":"smart-cities","name":"Smart Cities – Management of Smart Urban Infrastructures"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments! \n\nAccording to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers.

To receive credit for this course, you will need to complete the peer-reviewed final assignment.\n\nAs a participant, you will:\n- Watch videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium's approach to teaching and learning \n- Conduct personal investigations by engaging in hands-on activities based in those phenomena\n- Reflect and share your experience doing activities\n- Discuss and identify challenges and opportunities for teaching\n- Devise a lesson of your own based on one or more of the activities\n\nEach week, we'll look at a different light-related topic: We will start by examining human visual perception, then take a brief historical tour of our evolving scientific understanding. We’ll also look at optics and optical instruments and finish by looking at the wave nature of light. \n\nTo get the most out of this experience, you'll have to try out some activities! In return, you'll get lots of valuable teaching resources, an in-depth understanding of the subject matter, and useful tips and techniques for the classroom.\n\nNOTE: This is a hands-on workshop, so you will need to buy or find materials. All of the materials required are inexpensive and should be easy to obtain, and we welcome substitutions! A separate list of materials is available for each activity.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"physics-and-astronomy"}],"id":"WmHcj1BlEeWMlwoziUhyxQ","slug":"teach-light-color","name":"Exploring Light: Hands-on Activities and Strategies for Teachers"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Precision medicine has the potential to change fundamentally how health care is practiced, but requires a health care workforce that understands the complexities of this field. One important component of Precision Medicine is the use of an individual’s genomic information to offer targeted treatment, tailored to the individual. Our course aims to provide participants with some baseline knowledge of genomics, an overview of the clinical applications of genomic medicine, the skills to evaluate the clinical validity and utility of new tests, and an appreciation of the associated ethical and social issues inherent in this field.  \n\nThe course is geared toward practicing health care providers, although it should be accessible to anyone with a background in the biological sciences and a basic understanding of genetics.  It is designed to be succinct and clinically-focused, offering both conceptual and practical information about real-world applications of genomics.  Two lessons offer a basic primer on molecular genomics relevant to the individual patient as well as to patient populations. The remaining five lessons focus on five applications of genomics and present the material as case studies, highlighting the strengths, limitations, and issues that arise in the use of each test.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"clinical-science","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"id":"AoeC_mOvEeWMMg7wwTZV_Q","slug":"genomic-precision-medicine","name":"Genomic and Precision Medicine"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Курс разработан совместно c Фондом развития интернет-инициатив (ФРИИ) — самым активным российским фондом венчурных инвестиций.

Маленькие дети, пытаясь добиться того, чтобы родители купили понравившуюся конфетку, часто шантажируют родителей своими слезами. Принимая решение заплакать, ребенок рискует — он не знает, как поведут себя папа с мамой. В чуть более взрослом возрасте абитуриенты, выбирающие вуз, принимают сложное решение о том, в какие университеты подать документы. Ошибка может стоить дорого: при неправильной стратегии можно оказаться в слабом университете или вообще остаться без заветного студенческого билета. Окончив вуз, юноши и девушки начинают искать работу. Перед интервью с работодателем они штудируют статьи в интернете о том, что можно и чего нельзя говорить на интервью, — они пытаются найти наилучшую стратегию своего поведения, исходя из ожиданий компании, в которую они устраиваются. Все эти ситуации объединяет то, что решения, которые принимают одни люди, оказывают влияние на других людей. Такие взаимодействия называются стратегическими. Именно их изучает теория игр.\n\nЧтобы проанализировать ту или иную реальную жизненную ситуацию стратегического взаимодействия и найти оптимальный вариант поведения в ней, необходимо сделать две вещи. Во-первых, необходимо формально записать ситуацию на языке теории игр, то есть создать модель (игру). Во-вторых, после того как модель (игра) составлена, ее необходимо решить. Этому мы будем учиться в течение курса. Мы разберем основные виды игр (одновременные и последовательные, с совершенной и несовершенной информацией, коалиционные и некоалиционные), приведем способы их решения и обсудим их на многочисленных примерах.\n\nКурс будет интересен желающим разобраться в том, как конкурируют друг с другом несколько компаний и можно ли гарантированно выиграть в шашки, есть ли смысл угрожать на переговорах и с кем стоит объединяться в коалиции в парламенте.\n\nFAQ\n\nВ: Требуется ли предварительная подготовка для прохождения курса?\nО: Курс является базовым, поэтому он не требует специальной подготовки. Для его успешного освоения достаточно уверенных знаний курса математики в объеме школьной программы. В одном-двух примерах могут пригодиться знания начал математического анализа (дифференцирование функций одной переменной, необходимое условие экстремума) и знания начал теории вероятностей (понятие математического ожидания случайной величины).\n\nВ: Что требуется для успешного окончания курса?\nО: Итоговая оценка за курс складывается из результатов 10 оцениваемых тестов. Для успешного окончания курса необходимо дать не менее 80 % правильных ответов на каждый из этих тестов.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"IzWUDIo9EeWbIxKn7M-nSQ","slug":"game-theory","name":"Теория игр (Game Theory)"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Globalization has brought dramatic changes to the marketplace. A proliferation of global brands brings diverse cultures to a consumer population that is also growing culturally diverse. This course enables students to understand how globalization changes consumers at a psychological level, and provides tools for imbuing brands with cultural meanings—creating iconic brands—that can resonate with global consumers. The focus is on understanding that culture exists in the mind (e.g., values and beliefs) as well as in the environment (e.g., objects, brands, and institutions), and that globalization creates multi-cultural spaces in contemporary societies. Consumers can use the cultural meaning of a brand to build their identities (i.e., assimilate the brand cultural symbolism) or reject the brand’s cultural meaning(s) (i.e., exclusionary reactions).\n\nThe course will help students identify when assimilation vs. exclusionary reactions are more likely to occur, as well as devise strategies for imbuing brands with cultural meanings that can elevate them to the status of cultural icons. \n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how globalization impacts the psychological responses of consumers in global markets \n•\tUnderstand what culture is and how it manifests itself \n•\tUnderstand how brands acquire cultural meanings \n•\tPredict consumers’ responses to the cultural meanings in brands \n•\tIdentify strategies to win-over multi-cultural consumers in globalized markets \n•\tLearn how to build an iconic brand\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Некоторые люди никогда не задаются таким вопросом. Некоторые считают, что физика нужна исключительно для создания различных «девайсов», например холодильников или мобильных телефонов. И они в чем-то правы, ведь сказал же Оскар Уайльд, что «Комфорт – это единственное, что может нам дать цивилизация».\n\nДля нас физика – это умение видеть и понимать окружающий мир, возможность творить то, о чем раньше даже и мечтать было сложно. Мы считаем, что для дальнейшего прогресса человечества необходимы ученые-физики, инженеры-физики и просто образованные люди. Мы готовы делиться нашими знаниями. \n\nПредлагаемый курс «Электростатика и магнитостатика» посвящен рассмотрению ключевых понятий этой области: уравнений Максвелла, записанных в статическом случае как внутри вещества, так и вне его, энергетических подходов для вычисления сил, действующих на объекты, находящиеся электростатическом или магнитном поле, а также рассмотрение свойств для постоянных токов.\n\nСразу заметим – курс не очень простой, для его освоения слушателям необходимо владеть знаниями по физике в объеме школьной программы, основами дифференциального и интегрального исчисления и основами векторного исчисления.\n\nВ течение 10 недель вам будут предлагаться для изучения видеолекции, физические демонстрации и семинары с разбором задач. Основные формулы и тезисы лекций представлены в виде кратких конспектов. Каждая учебная неделя содержит тест и 4 задачи для самостоятельного решения.

It will also be useful to trainee teachers, school leaders, teacher educators and curriculum and assessment specialists, providing them with an understanding of the challenges associated with teaching and assessment of 21st century skills.\n\nThis course explains the social and cognitive skills that are known as 21st century skills. It reviews how they can be represented in the curriculum, in terms of developmental progressions. It also explores how teachers can recognise these skills in students, how the level of skill of a learner can be assessed, and then how learners can be supported to develop their skill. \n\nIn this course we work through two detailed examples of 21st century skills. The first is collaborative problem solving, a 21st century skill which combines the capacities of collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking and communication. The second skill is a meta-cognitive skill of knowing how to learn in a MOOC. In each example, you will explore how to understand the nature of each skill from a teaching perspective, how to teach it, and how to assess it. These two examples show how any 21st century skill can be tackled in the classroom.\n\nThe approach to teaching and assessment in this course derives from the application of a developmental, evidence-based, clinical approach to teaching practice.

However, we have used three key themes to explore our subjects: each key theme will be discussed over two week blocks by specialist course lecturers, and supported by unique video perspectives by three keynote speakers who are leading specialists in the field. \n\n - Weeks 1 & 2: An Introduction to Global Health Dr Amy Hughes MBE;\n - Weeks 3 & 4: Humanitarian Responses and Dilemmas Dr Tim Jacoby; \n - Weeks 5 & 6: The Right to Humanitarian Assistance and the Responsibility to Protect Dr Kirsten Howarth.\n\nTo get the best out of the course we encourage you to try and set aside a few hours each week. This will give you time to work through videos, written materials and linked resources, and to get involved with discussion with other learners. We have provided a variety of different readings, resources and suggested activity based on the course content. Some will be essential to your understanding of the MOOC themes, and to assessment (if you have chosen to take part in assessment activity). Others will be for those of you who want to discover more about a particular subject or perspective, or to make your own study of global health or humanitarianism in action. Check through the weekly resources and content to find out which best suit your needs.\n\nDuring the course we will look at a range of different opinions and debates, linked to key themes and addressing ethics and moral issues. We hope you will be inspired and encouraged to explore and share your own perspectives, and those of others, throughout the course. Different viewpoints are essential to understanding global health and humanitarian practice.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the next six weeks finding out about Global Health and Humanitarianism, and look forward to hearing from you on the discussion boards.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"id":"WCHihN8OEeWEQhLh6Nf2lQ","slug":"health-humanitarianism","name":"Global Health and Humanitarianism"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Do you have to give presentations in school or at your work?

The course focus on protecting innovations with copyright as one of several tools that can be used by companies and individuals to protect creative innovations.  In additional to learning about how copyright works in theory, we will also discuss situations in which copyright might not be effective in protecting innovations, and will focus on the legal issues involved from a practical business perspective rather than from a purely legal viewpoint.

First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. \n\nEach module is paired with a quiz and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.\n\nIf you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.\n\nLook forward to meeting you online!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nVatican Museums: www.museivaticani.va\nCenacolo Vinciano: \nwww.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1283837989.html (ITA)\nFAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano): eng.fondoambiente.it\nMUVE (Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia): www.visitmuve.it\nThe National Trust: www.nationaltrust.org.uk\nThe Archeological Site of Paestum: www.museopaestum.beniculturali.it   whc.unesco.org/en/list/842\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence): www.museumflorence.com\nMuseo del Violino: www.museodelviolino.org\n_________________________________\nDisclaimer - Since some of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and subtitles.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"marketing"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"id":"XdQwhCQcEeapkBKJ0Y_FqQ","slug":"arts-heritage","name":"Arts and Heritage Management"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This condensed survey course focuses on four key periods or themes from the history of design.

Business is about making money. Sustainability is about protecting the planet. Business is measured in months and quarters. Sustainability often requires significant short term costs to secure a sometimes uncertain long-term benefit. To some activists, all executives are exploitative, selfish one percenters. To some executives, all activists are irresponsible, unyielding extremists. \n\nAnd yet engaging with the issue isn’t optional – all businesses must have a strategy to deal with sustainability and, like any strategy, this involves making choices. \n\nThis Strategy and Sustainability course based on Rosenberg's recently published book by Palgrave (http://www.palgrave.com/la/book/9781137501738) that encourages learners to filter out the noise and make those choices in a hard-nosed and clear-eyed way. Prof. Rosenberg’s nuanced and fact-based point of view recognizes the complexity of the issues at hand and the strategic choices businesses must make. He blends the work of some of the leading academic thinkers in the field with practical examples from a variety of business sectors and geographies and offers a framework with which senior management might engage with the topic, not (just) to save the planet but to fulfill their short, medium and long-term responsibilities to shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThis course promises to be both engaging and thought-provoking, aimed at anyone who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of a subject that is no longer perceived as a choice but a necessity for future managers and business leaders alike.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-strategy"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"LiOKcgInEeaC3QpVD3K7WQ","slug":"strategy-sustainability","name":"Strategy and Sustainability"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"How can we know if the differences in wages between men and women are caused by discrimination or differences in background characteristics?

They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.

Mechanics begins by quantifying motion, and then explaining it in terms of forces, energy and momentum. This allows us to analyse the operation of many familiar phenomena around us, but also the mechanics of planets, stars and galaxies.\n\nThis on-demand course is recommended for senior high school and beginning university students and anyone with a curiosity about basic physics. (The survey tells us that it's often used by science teachers, too.) \n\nThe course uses rich multimedia tutorials to present the material: film clips of key experiments, animations and worked example problems, all with a friendly narrator. You'll do a range of interesting practice problems, and in an optional component, you will use your ingenuity to complete at-home experiments using simple, everyday materials.\n\nYou will need some high-school mathematics: arithmetic, a little algebra, quadratic equations, and the sine, cosine and tangent functions from trigonometry. The course does not use calculus. However, we do provide a study aid introducing the calculus that would accompany this course if it were taught in a university.\n\nBy studying mechanics in this course, you will understand with greater depth many of the wonders around you in everyday life, in technology and in the universe at large.

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults’) self expression.\n\nNB: This is a hands-on course, so you will need several tools and materials to do weekly activities. You are welcome to purchase only what you don't already have—or even better try to scrounge them from surplus stores! We have put together a list of recommended materials, which you can find here: http://bit.ly/motion-materials\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any specific “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on activities related to Motion and Mechanisms, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers, and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague, or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nThis project was funded by generous support from Overdeck Family Foundation and the National Science Foundation.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"id":"XqPMOzDrEeeckAoFzJuh9g","slug":"tinkering-motion-mechanisms","name":"Tinkering Fundamentals: Motion and Mechanisms"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"人性本質的開端是善或惡？成長與改變的原因是源自遺傳或環境？人類發展的過程是如小樹苗漸成大樹般的量變、還是如毛毛蟲變成蝴蝶般的質變？這些哲學爭辯顯示了同一個發展現象背後可能有不同的立場，因而需以縱貫追蹤或橫跨不同世代的跨齡研究設計探討人類發展的本質。此外，發展心理學欲瞭解的對象往往包括無法聽從研究者指示、或無法以語言、文字充分表達自己的嬰幼兒與兒童，因此需以特殊的研究派典才能回答發展趨勢、發展歷程是否為連續、以及個別差異是否隨發展保持穩定等議題。因此，本課程的主旨有二，一為說明各種看待發展的哲學觀、另一則為介紹發展心理學的研究設計與方法。","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"electrical-engineering"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"vTiSs9b9Eea7lQ7A_W1MbA","slug":"developmental-psychology","name":"發展心理學：哲學觀與方法論 (Developmental Psychology: Philosophical Bases and Methodology)"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course introduces core areas of statistics that will be useful in business and for several MBA modules.

Why use C# instead of C++, Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First, using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework, which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.\n\nThat learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.\n\nComputer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!\n\nCaution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do).

Regression is the engine behind a multitude of data analytics applications used for many forms of forecasting and prediction.  \nThis is the fourth course in the specialization, \"Business Statistics and Analysis\". The course  introduces you to the very important tool known as Linear Regression. You will learn to apply various procedures such as dummy variable regressions, transforming variables, and interaction effects. All these are introduced and explained using easy to understand examples in Microsoft Excel.\nThe focus of the course is on understanding and application, rather than detailed mathematical derivations.\nNote: This course uses the ‘Data Analysis’ tool box which is standard with the Windows version of Microsoft Excel. It is also standard with the 2016 or later Mac version of Excel. However, it is not standard with earlier versions of Excel for Mac. \n\n\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Regression Analysis: An Introduction\nIn this module you will get introduced to the Linear Regression Model. We will build a regression model and estimate it using Excel. We will use the estimated model to infer relationships between various variables and use the model to make predictions. The module also introduces the notion of errors, residuals and R-square in a regression model.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the Linear Regression\n•\tBuilding a Regression Model and estimating it using Excel\n•\tMaking inferences using the estimated model\n•\tUsing the Regression model to make predictions\n•\tErrors, Residuals and R-square\n \n\nWEEK 2\nModule 2: Regression Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Goodness of Fit\nThis module presents different hypothesis tests you could do using the Regression output. These tests are an important part of inference and the module introduces them using Excel based examples. The p-values are introduced along with goodness of fit measures R-square and the adjusted R-square. Towards the end of module we introduce the ‘Dummy variable regression’ which is used to incorporate categorical variables in a regression. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tHypothesis testing in a Linear Regression\n•\t‘Goodness of Fit’ measures (R-square, adjusted R-square)\n•\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)\n \n\nWEEK 3\nModule 3: Regression Analysis: Dummy Variables, Multicollinearity\nThis module continues with the application of Dummy variable Regression. You get to understand the interpretation of Regression output in the presence of categorical variables. Examples are worked out to re-inforce various concepts introduced. The module also explains what is Multicollinearity and how to deal with it. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)\n•\tInterpretation of coefficients and p-values in the presence of Dummy variables\n•\tMulticollinearity in Regression Models\n \n\nWEEK 4\nModule 4: Regression Analysis: Various Extensions\nThe module extends your understanding of the Linear Regression, introducing techniques such as mean-centering of variables and building confidence bounds for predictions using the Regression model. A powerful regression extension known as ‘Interaction variables’ is introduced and explained using examples. We also study the transformation of variables in a regression and in that context introduce the log-log and the semi-log regression models. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tMean centering of variables in a Regression model\n•\tBuilding confidence bounds for predictions using a Regression model\n•\tInteraction effects in a Regression\n•\tTransformation of variables\n•\tThe log-log and semi-log regression models","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"data-analysis","domainId":"data-science"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"id":"vFMJd7vTEeWHHg6FD3PArQ","slug":"linear-regression-business-statistics","name":"Linear Regression for Business Statistics"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The University of California San Diego, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Drug Commercialization course brings you lectures from both faculty and industry experts.   With this course, recorded on campus at UCSD, we seek to share our access to top people in the field who bring an unprecedented range of expertise on drug commercialization.\n\nThis course will cover pharmacoeconomic, marketing strategy, intellectual property strategy, portfolio management, managed markets and strategic alliances. It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.\n\nIn addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.  \n\nThis course is intended as part 3 of a series: Drug Discovery (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-discovery), Drug Development (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-development) and Drug Commercialization.

To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.\n\nDoping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. \nIn efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).\n\nTeaser:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Q3eR_g7rU\n\nMain Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able to :\n\n1.\tIdentify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures,\n5.\tIdentify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"psychology","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"biology","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"id":"7GFLpG5wEeWSPQr3Cum54Q","slug":"doping","name":"Doping : Sports, Organizations and Sciences"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Comer bien en una vuelta al mundo no es tarea fácil .

Epidemiology in public health practice uses study design and analyses to identify causes in an outbreak situation, guides interventions to improve population health, and evaluates programs and policies.\n\nIn this course, we'll define the role of the professional epidemiologist as it relates to public health services, functions, and competencies. With that foundation in mind, we'll introduce you to the problem solving methodology and demonstrate how it can be used in a wide variety of settings to identify problems, propose solutions, and evaluate interventions. This methodology depends on the use of reliable data, so we'll take a deep dive into the routine and public health data systems that lie at the heart of epidemiology and then conclude with how you can use that data to calculate measures of disease burden in populations.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"qzwLIm32EeabgxL_CsKzaQ","slug":"epidemiology-public-health","name":"Epidemiology in Public Health Practice"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizations survive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten their current way of life.  We will look at a general model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries that have failed or are close to failing.  Examples of companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old, Blockbuster and Borders.   It is likely that each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak and Blockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated.  Disruptions are impacting industries like education; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a challenge for Universities.  In addition to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are doing well.  What are their strategies for survival?\n\nBy highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing from happening to them.   Through the study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to disruptions that actually work.

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly.

The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered \"lifeline infrastructure\" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards.

Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.\n\nPart 1 (this course) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’.\n\nPart 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\n\nCourse Overview video: https://youtu.be/dzUPRyJ4ETk","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"data-analysis","domainId":"data-science"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"9Ts-vzIDEeaTbQ5NZghBBw","slug":"understanding-china-history-part-1","name":"Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach, Part 1"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course will introduce you to some of the main areas of research in contemporary philosophy.

В нашем курсе мы познакомим слушателей прежде всего с самыми основами предмета. И сделаем мы это в уникальном формате - иллюстрируя вероятностные объекты и методы на примерах решения с их помощью комбинаторных задач. Суть в том, что, конечно, в базовой вероятности много комбинаторики, и это все знают; мы же расскажем не только об этом, но и о том, как, наоборот, вероятностные методы позволяют работать с комбинаторными задачами. Это позволит нам впоследствии выйти на приложения вероятности в теории графов, случайных графов и, наконец, веб-графов и прочих сложных сетей. Также в рамках курса мы оторвемся от чисто комбинаторных интерпретаций и обсудим более общие вероятностные модели. Но интуиция все равно сохранится, и в этой комбинаторной подоплеке уникальность курса.\n\nКурс построен так, что будет по плечу даже тем, кто изучал математику последний раз только в школе.

Теперь создание устройств, которые взаимодействуют с физическим миром, доступно даже школьнику. \n\nНаш курс состоит из серии практических задач про создание вещей, которые работают сами: изучают мир, принимают решения и действуют – двигаются, обмениваются данными друг с другом и с человеком, управляют другими устройствами. Мы покажем, как собирать эти устройства и программировать их, используя в качестве основы платформу Arduino.\n\nПройдя этот курс, вы сможете создавать устройства, которые считывают данные о внешнем мире с разнообразных датчиков, обрабатывают информацию, получают и отправляют данные на ПК, в Интернет, на мобильные устройства, управляют индикацией и движением. Создание устройств будет включать проектирование, изучение компонентов, сборку схем, написание программ, диагностику. Попутно с созданием самих устройств вы сделаете визуализацию на ПК, создадите веб-страницу, которую будет демонстрировать одно из ваших устройств, а также разберетесь с устройством и работой FDM 3D-принтера. \n\nПомимо тех, кто увлекается робототехникой или стремится расширить кругозор и свои навыки, курс будет полезен всем, кто сталкивается с задачами бытовой и производственной автоматизации, а также занимается промышленным дизайном, рекламой и искусством.\n\nКурс не требует специальных знаний у слушателей, доступен даже ученикам старших классов средней школы. Плюсом будут навыки программирования и владение английским языком на уровне чтения технической документации, однако обязательным это не является.\n\nВесь курс посвящен практике и самым лучшим решением для вас будет раздобыть электронику, повторять показанные примеры и экспериментировать самостоятельно.\n\nПриобрести комплекты можно здесь – shop.cyberphysica.ru","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"electrical-engineering"},{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"id":"FioEDkKkEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ","slug":"roboty-arduino","name":"Строим роботов и другие устройства на Arduino.

No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família, proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários, entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.\n\nEste curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. \n\nCada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:  \n•\tQuais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?\n•\tQue diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?\n•\tQual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?\n•\tQuais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?\n•\tQuais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?\n•\tQuais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  \n\nDurante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica. \n\nDependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que \"É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad\".\n\nApós assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.\n\nThis is a translated version.

You will learn that child development is complex and is influenced by a surprisingly rich number of factors at many different levels of organization. You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.\n\nIn order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.\n\nTo illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University.

First, it is shown how age-at-death, sex and stature can be estimated by the close examination of (archaeological) skeletal remains. In subsequent modules it is shown how human bones can provide information about the diseases and injuries that people suffered from and what they ate. Also, it is shown how the human skeleton provides information about the kinds of activities that people engaged in and about how they migrated and moved around their landscapes. \n\nIn this course, you will examine all aspects of the human skeleton that can provide us with information about these different facets of life.

Феномен призвания неизменно интересен всем, кто изучал и изучает проблемы мотивации, счастья, лидерства.\nВ основе курса лежит идея о первичности целого, хорошего, настоящего, о том, что плохое – это испорченное хорошее, и мы можем возвращаться к хорошему, то есть к целому, воспитывая в себе и в других чувствительность к призванию.  \n\nПрактический смысл курса\n\nВ современном мире, ставшем в некоторых социальных направлениях очень тесным, жестким жить по призванию становится не только желательно, но и необходимо.\nПрагматический смысл изучения психологии можно свести к проблеме мотивации. Мотивация бывает разного качества. Если вы понимаете, как возникает и сохраняется мотивация, вы владеете ситуацией. Если мотивация для вас – неизвестность, случайность, сомнение и пр., то ситуация владеет вами. Данный курс способствует опыту осознания решающих точек вашего возможного «возвышения до человека» и «падения до человека»   \n\nЦели курса\n\nДанный курс построен на диалектике призвания и принуждения. Нечувствительность к призванию ведет к принуждению, длящемуся до тех пор, пока чувствительность к призванию не будет восстановлена. Эта закономерность справедлива для самых разных уровней человеческого диалога с миром. Кем бы вы ни были: родителями, воспитателями, преподавателями, руководителями, тренерами, командирами, супругами, для вас будет полезным точно понимать: что такое призвание и принуждение, как они появляются и проявляются в вашей жизни. \nПроявления жизни по призванию - это обновление, жизнестойкость, инициатива, талант, эффективность. Но мы не всегда в достаточной степени чутки, открыты к призванию. Этот курс направлен на то, чтобы развить Вашу чувствительность к интонациям призвания и принуждения в жизни вообще и в конкретных делах в частности.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"},{"subdomainId":"psychology","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"A06r2j6XEea_VAogyls_Sw","slug":"psykhologiya-prizvaniya","name":"Психология призвания"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Have a look at our trailer for a brief introduction to this course: https://youtu.be/GADAgxTHjgE \n\nIn this course, you learn how the agro-food value chain approaches the challenge of constantly improving its competitiveness by producing high quality food and products and also aiming to attain greater sustainability.

This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’ and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities.\n\nAn appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.\n\nWe examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"-GA2-bmnEeWkwBIgnN7tuw","slug":"community-public-health","name":"Community Change in Public Health"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?\n\nThis is surely one of life’s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. \n\nFor Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling.

The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.\nThe course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs.

But what is culture exactly, and how does it impact on negotiation, in particular? \n\nThis course will help you to be more precise about different dimensions of culture, from one region or country to another, while helping you to avoid simplifications, clichés and stereotypes. It will also lead you to a better overall awareness of your own culture.\n\nIn addition the course modules will guide you to a better understanding of when and how cultural differences are likely to influence the different dimensions of a negotiation - the people, problems and processes. Armed with that understanding, your awareness, preparation and strategy will be enhanced when you are faced with negotiators from cultures and regions different from your own. Your ability to anticipate and react, your negotiation flexibility, will be improved and refined.\n\nThe course also gives you a concrete look at quite different national and regional negotiation styles  (we look at the French, Chinese, North American and Middle Eastern). In addition, an examination of negotiation in two multicultural settings (European Union institutions, on the one hand, and the recent COP 21 climate conference in Paris, on the other) highlights the importance of well-designed negotiation processes for getting both efficiency and fairness.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"id":"N7hNkxv9EealIRJP087Tdw","slug":"international-negotiation","name":"International and Cross-Cultural Negotiation"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Ce cours vise principalement à permettre aux étudiants d’identifier les sources pertinentes dans un domaine donné, leur apprendre à construire un état de l’art et à évaluer les sources, en particulier celles en accès libre sur Internet.

Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\n\nGeneral Overview Help Center\n\nUrbanization is reaching a new peak in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities. Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll video produced by Sciences Po for this Mooc are under Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nRecommended Background\nThe course is designed for undergraduates but it also will interest graduates and professionals concerned in urban issues.\n\nThe course is organized in 8 sequences and displays multimedia contents (images, video, original documents).

The first module develops a model of macroeconomy in the short run when the price level has its own momentum and does not respond much to supply and demand forces. The model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the foreign exchange market. It then connects the long-run outcome with expectations about the future trends in the exchange rate at each moment, which constitute a key driver of the spot exchange rate in the short run. The methodology developed for this purpose can be applied to expectations concerning other macroeconomic variables as well. Finally, the long-run foreign exchange model is employed to derive a number of important lessons for the long run trends in currency values and competitiveness of producers in various countries.\n\nThe third module examines the drivers of aggregate output in the long run and the mechanisms of adjustment from the short run to the long run. The model provides insights about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them. It connects these deviations to country characteristics that one needs to take into account when assessing a country’s long-term macroeconomic environment. The module ends with a discussion of the institutional conditions that help bring about better fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how the market for aggregate goods and services interacts with the money market to shape the macroeconomic equilibrium that determines income, interest rate, and exchange rate in the short run.\n•\tUnderstand the links between the short-run and long-run processes.\n•\tAssess the dynamic effects of macroeconomic policies and understand the roles of globalization, government policies, institutions, and expectations in macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its co0nnection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and manmade. For most of history the manmade variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their \"surpassing disproportion\". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.

We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are.

Can you prove that it is valid without using modus ponens itself and thereby assuming that it is valid? If so, how? If not, what does this show about the validity of modus ponens?\n\nHow can phrases like \"and\", \"or\", \"if\", and \"not\" work as \"truth-functional connectives\"?\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to evaluate deductive arguments for validity. In particular, you will learn new ways of representing the information that is contained in the premises of a deductive argument. Using these new representational devices (devices that we call \"truth tables\" and \"Venn diagrams\"), we will be able to apply rules to determine whether or not a particular deductive argument is valid. \n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 6 and 7 by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format:\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups.

Too often though our perceptions about Aboriginal peoples consign them to an ancient past or perpetuates stereotypical imaginations that Aboriginal peoples live in remote communities (Hinkson, 2010).  \n\nAt the heart of this MOOC is the theme that Sovereignty was never ceded and Sydney always was and always will be Aboriginal Land. Despite this the Aboriginal presence in the city is often invisible to non-Aboriginal eyes. This course aims to bring to light marginalised narratives of Aboriginal presence in this space.\n\nTo understand hidden and marginalised narratives and experiences it is necessary to develop cultural competence capabilities. Key elements of practicing cultural competence include being able to understand and interrogate context, which in the case of Sydney includes not only learning about the peoples, places and histories of Aboriginal Sydney but to also understand issues about how knowledge is created and how dominant narratives can exclude diverse knowledges and experiences. \n\nCourse learning outcomes\n\n1.\tDevelop knowledge about cultural competence capabilities. \n2.\tDevelop a deeper and multi-layered knowledge and understanding about Aboriginal peoples, cultures and places in Sydney.\n3.\tDevelop a greater understanding of how history, cultures and places are represented, contested and interpreted and how that relates to their own context. \n\nAcknowledgement of Country\n\nWe acknowledge that this course was developed on the land of the Gadigal Peoples of the Eora nation.

Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions?

Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today.

You will learn the basic concepts of linguistics, get to know some of the key features of big and small languages and get insight into what linguists do.\n\nThis course gives an introduction into the study of languages, the field of linguistics. With the support of the basic linguistic terminology that is offered in the course, you will soon be able to comment both on variety between languages, as well as on a single language’s internal structure. Anyone who wishes to understand how languages work, and how they can give us insight into the human mind is very welcome to join.\n\nThe course is useful if you want to get a fairly quick introduction into linguistics, for instance because you are considering studying it further, or because you are interested in a neighbouring discipline such as psychology, computer science or anthropology. Furthermore, the course will help you develop analytical skills.\n\nIf you are curious to understand how language works and how it gives insight into the human mind, this course is definitely for you!","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"language-learning","subdomainId":"other-languages"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"id":"fM5baJoUEeW93wo8Ha4kow","slug":"human-language","name":"Miracles of Human Language: An Introduction to Linguistics"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Jewish Diaspora in China is a unique experience for world Jewry, as China is the only country in Far East that has had Jews living in its society for over 1,000 years. Documentary evidence shows that Jews started to live in China no later than the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The famous Kaifeng Jewish community, which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive? Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story of Jews in modern China is certainly a fascinating and up-lifting one. This course will examine these questions and more.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"name":"Jewish Diaspora in Modern China","id":"nnd5lshWEeSA1yIACye2oA","slug":"jews-in-china"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is for anyone interested in learning more about Veterinary Medicine, giving a “taster” of courses covered in the first year of a veterinary degree and an idea of what it is like to study Veterinary Medicine.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"animals-and-veterinary-science","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"name":"EDIVET: Do you have what it takes to be a veterinarian?","id":"ClCx1sbdEeShXyIAC5MC2w","slug":"becoming-a-veterinarian"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"本课程将介绍各领域专家所使用的学习方法，他们包括艺术家、文学家、数学家、科学家、运动员和很多其他领域专家。我们将学习如何使用两种不同的大脑模式，以及大脑如何封装（“chunks”）信息。我们还将介绍能力错觉（illusions of learning），记忆技巧，对付拖延症的方法，以及研究表明能帮助我们掌握困难科目的方法。\n\n无论您在所学领域是专家还是菜鸟，您都可以使用这些方法，改变自己的思维模式，重塑自己的人生。如果您是所学领域的专家，通过学习大脑认知的底层知识，您可以进一步提高自己的学习能力，您将了解反直觉的考试技巧和见解，从而能够更高效地完成作业和习题。如果您在学习中遇到困难，系统有效的学习技巧将帮助您将走上正轨。无论您希望学习什么内容，这门课程都可以作为您的指南。","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"name":"学会如何学习：帮助你掌握复杂学科的强大智力工具（Learning How to Learn）","id":"pSaP4p3ZEeW_wArffOXkOw","slug":"ruhe-xuexi"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing.

Systems  thinking is a core skill in public health and helps health policymakers build programs and policies that are aware of and prepared for unintended consequences.\n\nAn important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives and synthesize them into a framework or model that can describe and predict the various ways in which a system might react to policy change.

The main question here is the following. If we need to count something, can we do anything better than just counting all objects one by one? Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics.\n\nIn this course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type. We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems. This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge. Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations.\n\nOne of the main `consumers’ of Combinatorics is Probability Theory. This area is connected with numerous sides of life, on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning. In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area. The practice shows that such an intuition is not easy to develop.\n\nIn the end of the course we will create a program that successfully plays a tricky and very counterintuitive dice game.\n\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity.

Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?\n\nEven within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements. \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Mary Wollstonecraft, and John Stuart Mill; and more contemporary theorists such as Elizabeth Anderson, Isaiah Berlin, Thomas Christiano, Frantz Fanon, Amy Gutmann, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Nozick, Martha Nussbaum, Julius Nyerere, Ayn Rand, John Rawls, Peter Singer, and Kok-Chor Tan. \n\nThe aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the views of those with whom you disagree.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"name":"Revolutionary Ideas: Utility, Justice, Equality, Freedom","id":"5-A3g_KJEeS3yyIAC4eMqw","slug":"political-philosophy"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Экономическая социология опирается на длинную и богатую интеллектуальную традицию и в то же время является молодой, становящейся.

You have come a long way since the beginning of this journey from Smartphone Basics to DSLR and Beyond.  Just think of all the information you have absorbed and put to use in your assignments and quizzes, and the confidence you have gained that you CAN control the camera to make pictures you are proud to share.  \n\nHere in Course Four you will start by gaining knowledge related to content in photography, from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive.  Next you will learn principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light in Ambient/Natural settings.  \n\nThe flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in to your camera or an add-on \"hotshoe\" model, will finally be something you, not the camera, controls!  You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious, as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.  \n\nThere is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.  This Course is the last before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project over a 2-month period of dedicated photography.  The Peer Review photography assignments have been structured with both your advanced capabilities and dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both!  Be prepared to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments, because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!\n\nCourse Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs as well.  The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also yours to discover.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual's creative effort, well that is  important knowledge to have in preparation for the Capstone too!

They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points.

In this course, you will discover the organization of the neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation, motivate bodily action, and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory, emotion and related faculties of cognition. The overall goal of this course is to provide the foundation for understanding the impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany injury, disease or dysfunction in the central nervous system. The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy, as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.\n\nThis online course is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry) and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit 3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition, and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next, we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks 11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"biology","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"id":"Nyq7nXzPEeWb-BLhFdaGww","slug":"medical-neuroscience","name":"Medical Neuroscience"},{"courseType":"v2.capstone","description":"Apply the skills you learned during the sequence of courses -- from needfinding to visual design -- as you redesign a new interface, service, or product for your Interaction Design Capstone Project.

For over a century we have been drawing fossil fuels – oil, coal and natural gas – from the depths of the earth, and using them to power our world: advanced industries, fast transportation, comfortable homes and more. In this course we will examine possible alternatives for these fuels - which have proved quite damaging to both our health and our environment. We will describe the intensive worldwide efforts in this field of research, and present their encouraging outcome: a range of innovative technologies for generating clean energy from natural, non-polluting and renewable sources – such as sunlight, wind and water.\n\nThe course will open with some fundamental questions on energy: What are the energy needs of the global population today, and what will they be tomorrow? What are the resources at our disposal? What are the known processes for harvesting, converting and utilizing resources of energy? What are the problems generated by the use of fossil fuels? In what ways must we change our energy policies and energy economy? And most important of all: What are the alternatives to fossil fuels, and can they supply humanity's extensive and constantly growing energy needs?\n\nSubsequent lessons will introduce the main types of safe, clean, natural and renewable energy sources available to us: solar energy, wind energy, water energy and bioenergy. We will speak of existing technologies that already harness these resources to the needs of humankind, and supply simple tools for computing conversion efficiencies, calculating the amounts of energy produced through the various methods, and assessing their economic feasibility.\n\nIn parallel, we will discuss the remaining problems and challenges, and ask what must be done to enable the large-scale use of renewable energy – in industry, in transportation, and in every other sphere of our lives. We will examine several advanced renewable energy technologies; explain why they have not yet taken the place of fossil fuels; and present cutting-edge innovations and promising research directions – in the ongoing global effort to ensure a sustainable future for us all.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"id":"GLXIL6hzEeWu-gqgbeGTiQ","slug":"renewable-energy","name":"מבוא לאנרגיה מתחדשת -  Introduction to Renewable Energy"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is for teachers to learn why some children have so much difficulty with reading and writing, often called 'dyslexia', and to learn more about best practice in teaching literacy to all in light of recent scientific discoveries.\n\nParticipation in or completion of this online course will not confer academic credit for University of London programmes","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"education"}],"id":"eo6NBCQPEeW5Rwo0txKkgQ","slug":"dyslexia-difficulties","name":"Supporting children with difficulties in reading and writing"},{"courseType":"v2.capstone","description":"Welcome to the capstone project course in the Coursera Inspirational Leadership Specialization! \nIn the next 6 weeks you'll apply the skills you learned in the Specialization to tackle a real world leadership challenge. \n\nTo better meet your own goals of taking this Specialization, we will provide one capstone project: \n\n-Personal leadership challenge; \n\nYou'll select one project to implement and will receive assessments from your Capstone peers.

Hence, their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).\n\nFirst, a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case, the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model, we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood, mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems. \n\nModel checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method, model checking analyzes\nthe functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model, it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.\nThe main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains, for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms. The learning objectives of this course are as follows:\n\n- Express dependability properties for different kinds of transition systems .\n- Compute the evolution over time for Markov chains.\n- Check whether single states satisfy a certain formula and compute the satisfaction set for properties.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"id":"mG_-am-IEeWbbw5cIAKQrw","slug":"quantitative-model-checking","name":"Quantitative Model Checking"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The Arch of Titus: Rome and the Menorah explores one of the most significant Roman monuments to survive from antiquity, from the perspectives of Roman, Jewish and later Christian history and art.

To appreciate, quite simply, means to value and to recognize that which has value—it is a way of knowing and valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship it means a research focus—a positive bias—seeking fresh understanding of dynamics described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional and life-giving. \n\nIn this context the word appreciate means to value those things of value—it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful for—it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path of life's journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in value too. Combining the three—appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way of being and as an increase in value– suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice.  As a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and understood as a seamless and integral whole \n\nLeading Positive Change through Appreciative Inquiry is a course dedicated to advancing our understanding and skill in leading strength-based change and on how to create, foster and manage organizations in which people thrive and perform at their best.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"id":"6OW7QJ3WEeWILQ7D3uPEMw","slug":"appreciative-inquiry","name":"Leading Positive Change through Appreciative Inquiry"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The simple spreadsheet is one of the most powerful data analysis tools that exists, and it’s available to almost anyone.

Do I cross the road now, or wait for the oncoming truck to pass? Should I eat fries or a salad for lunch? How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?\n\nBehavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices.

Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war?

Words and pictures—the building blocks of graphic design—are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the digital world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture.\n\nThrough visual examples, this course will teach you the fundamental principles of graphic design: imagemaking, typography, composition, working with color and shape... foundational skills that are common in all areas of graphic design practice. I don't just want you to watch a video of someone talking about design, I want you to MAKE design! If you want to be a designer you have to be a maker, a communicator, so this course will offer you lots of opportunities to get your hands dirty with exercises and with more practical projects.\n\nAt the end of this course you will have learned how to explore and investigate visual representation through a range of image-making techniques; have understand basic principles of working with shape, color and pattern; been exposed to the language and skills of typography; and understand and have applied the principles of composition and visual contrast. If you complete the course, along with its optional (but highly recommended) briefs, you will have a core set of graphic design skills that you can apply to your own projects, or to more deeply investigate a specialized area of graphic design.\n\nTo succeed in this course you will need access to a computer.

How did social norms about same sex marriage change more rapidly than anyone anticipated?  Why do some social innovations take off with relative ease, while others struggle for years without spreading?  More generally, what are the forces that control the process of social evolution –from the fashions that we wear, to our beliefs about religious tolerance, to our ideas about the process of scientific discovery and the best ways to manage complex research organizations? \n\nThe social world is complex and full of surprises. Our experiences and intuitions about the social world as individuals are often quite different from the behaviors that we observe emerging in large societies. Even minor changes to the structure of a social network - changes that are unobservable to individuals within those networks - can lead to radical shifts in the spread of new ideas and behaviors through a population. These “invisible” mathematical properties of social networks have powerful implications for the ways that teams solve problems, the social norms that are likely to emerge, and even the very future of our society.  \n\nThis course condenses the last decade of cutting-edge research on these topics into six modules.

Shocked by economic assumptions of human behavior as self-centered and focusing only on what can be measured? Asking yourself if there are no sensible economic alternatives to free markets? Then you are at the right place to learn economics! \n\nThis is the first online course that teaches economics from a pluralist perspective. Economic pluralism means that a plurality of theoretical and methodological viewpoints is regarded as valuable in itself and is simply the best way in which economics can make progress in understanding the world. This MOOC will illustrate economic pluralism not only in substance but also in form. You will see not only me, a Professor of Economics, but also a pop-up Prof of our business school, who illustrates the actor perspective of firms, government and civil society. And you will meet an online student, based in Greece, who will help you through the tutorial videos in which I will explain key concepts, tools and techniques. \n\nI will not limit myself to the dominant theory, as almost every other course does. Instead, I will introduce you to four very different economic theories for the whole set of standard topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics. The theories are presented every time from broad and more interdisciplinary to narrow and more mathematical. The four theories that I like to introduce you to are Social Economics, Institutional Economics, Post Keynesian economics and, at the very end of each topic, Neoclassical Economics, for the special case of ideally functioning markets. But not everything is different in this course. Like every economics course, it includes numbers, diagrams, tables, equations, and some calculations. \n\nWhy would you go through the effort of learning the basics of four theories instead of one? Because it will help you to see why many economists cannot predict crises, whereas others can see signals but are often not being listened to because they do not belong to the dominant school of thought. It will also enable you to see that it is just one theory claiming economic agents to be self-centered and focusing on the measurable only. Other economic theories go well beyond these limitations. And, finally, the pluralist approach will provide you with policy alternatives to neoliberalist policies promoting free markets. \n\nThe objective of this course is twofold. First, to enable you to understand different economic viewpoints, linked to important traditions in economic thought, and basic economic concepts belonging to these theoretical perspectives. Second, to enable you to do some basic economic calculations that are important in economic life, such as calculating an inflation rate, and in economic policies, such as estimating the rough gains from trade for both trading partners, and in economic arguments, such as in calculating utility maximization with given prices and budgets.\n\nI hope you will enjoy the

Son étude lui permet d'expliquer pourquoi les racines d'une équation prise au hasard ne s'expriment en général pas par des formules algébriques faisant intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un résultat démontré auparavant par Abel. Plus généralement, l'étude du groupe de Galois du polynôme permet de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe. C'est ce que l'on appelle la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d'une part la théorie des corps, d'autre part la théorie des groupes.Ce cours expliquera cette théorie en n'utilisant que des résultats de base d'algèbre linéaire. Nous étudierons d'un côté la théorie des corps, c'est-à-dire la façon dont les corps s'emboîtent les uns dans les autres, en introduisant la notion de nombre algébrique (essentiellement les racines de polynômes). D'un autre côté, nous introduirons les éléments nécessaires à l'étude des groupes de permutations. Cela nous permettra d'expliquer la théorie de Galois, non seulement dans son cadre d'origine, c'est-à-dire quand les coefficients du polynôme sont des nombres entiers, mais aussi dans un cadre plus général, par exemple lorsqu'on réduit ces coefficients modulo un nombre premier p.\n\nLe cours culminera avec une comparaison des groupes de Galois dans ces deux situations (« entière » et après réduction modulo p), fournissant ainsi un outil de calcul puissant de ces groupes.\n\nCe cours est l'occasion d'aborder des notions d'algèbre variées, essentielles dans de nombreux domaines des mathématiques, de manière très simple pour très rapidement aboutir à des résultats tout à fait remarquables. Nous n'avons pas cherché la généralité maximale mais au contraire à aller rapidement à l'essentiel en utilisant le minimum de formalisme abstrait. Le FLOTeur intéressé sera alors armé pour aller plus loin, notamment grâce à la bibliographie ou à des cours plus avancés.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"}],"id":"00citU52EeW2EwoziUhyxQ","slug":"theorie-de-galois","name":"Introduction à la théorie de Galois"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Издавна среди жителей Кёнигсберга была распространена такая загадка: как пройти по всем мостам через реку Преголя, не проходя ни по одному из них дважды. Многие кёнигсбержцы пытались решить эту задачу как теоретически, так и практически во время прогулок. Доказать или опровергнуть возможность существования такого маршрута никто не мог до 1736 года, когда выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер не написал письмо своему другу с решением. Ответ был «нельзя». Так и родилась теория графов. Но что будет, если процесс, который описывает граф – случаен?\n\nТеория случайных графов находится на стыке теории графов и теории вероятностей. Наука появилась в середине ХХ века, и она сразу же привлекла огромное внимание как со стороны чистых математиков, так и со стороны прикладников. В курсе мы изучим как основы теории случайных графов, так и настоящие ее жемчужины.\n\nМы научимся воспринимать многие сложные системы как \"случайные графы\".

The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.\n\nThe course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an\nintroductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is\nnatural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not\nformal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a\ncompetent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional\nanalysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the\nmethods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite\nElement Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical\nfoundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner\npresented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,\nalthough the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.\n\nThe development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):\nelliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to\nthe physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in\none dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We\nthen move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and\nmass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems\nin vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next\n(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in\nthree dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to\nquestions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who\nfollowed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical\ndevelopment to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.\n\nBooks:\nThere are many books on finite element methods.

It examines a range of dynamic interactions in the unfolding of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities. It investigates ways in which we understand evolutionary processes and the implications for humans and our ecological future.  \n\nThe Journey course, thus, is based on a new integration that is emerging from the dialogue of the sciences and humanities. Journey tells the story of evolution as an epic narrative, rather than as a series of facts separated by scientific disciplines. This changes our perception so that we begin to see ourselves as an integral part of this narrative. By situating ourselves within this story we can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of processes such as self-organizing dynamics, natural selection, emergence, symbiosis, and co-evolution. As we discover these intricate processes of evolution, we awaken to the beauty and complexity of our natural environment at this critical juncture in our planetary history.\n\nUpcoming sessions\nMay 8, 2017 - June 26, 2017\nJune 5, 2017 - July 24, 2017\nJuly 3, 2017 - August 21, 2017\nJuly 31, 2017 - September 18, 2017\nAugust 28, 2017 - October 16, 2017\nSeptember 25, 2017 - November 13, 2017","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"id":"LANMc0UsEeaJwxI8cURk2w","slug":"journey-of-the-universe","name":"Journey of the Universe: The Unfolding of Life"},{"courseType":"v2.capstone","description":"Welcome to the Capstone Project for Big Data!

При этом только 3-4% из них может быть выращено в лабораторных условиях, а об остальных мы не знаем практически ничего.\n\nДетальный анализ состава и функционирования сложных сообществ позволяет ответить на многие вопросы, связанные со здоровьем человека, охраной окружающей среды, хранением и переработкой продуктов питания, разработкой альтернативных источников энергии, и т.д. Такой анализ возможен только в результате биоинформатической обработки огромных массивов данных, получаемых при секвенировании суммарной метагеномной ДНК и/или отдельных генов.\n\nВ предлагаемом курсе «Введение в биоинформатику: метагеномика» мы затронем вопросы подготовки метагеномных проб и особенностей их анализа; математических подходов, лежащих в основе созданных специально для этого типа данных программных продуктов; вопросы секвенирования и сборки метагеномов, их аннотации и применения.\nВ ходе курса участникам будет предложен проект, в котором они смогут на практике применить полученные знания.\nВ рамках этого проекта учащиеся будут самостоятельно работать с реальными данными, проведут самостоятельный анализ и сделают выводы о составе и функции выбранного для этого проекта сообщества.\n\nКурс «Введение в биоинформатику: метагеномика» преследует три главные цели:\n1. ознакомить вас с  задачами, которые ставит необходимость исследования сложных микробных сообществ перед медиками, биологами, программистами и математиками;  методами их решения;  программными продуктами и аналитическими платформами, созданными для работы с метагеномными данными;  математическими алгоритмами, лежащими в основе этих программ\n2. привить экспериментальные навыки работы с метагеномными данными, умение правильно планировать эксперимент,  оценивать сложность задачи и требуемых для ее решения ресурсов (лабораторных и компьютерных),  оценивать качество произведенных данных с точки зрения поставленной задачи, \n3. научить правильно выбирать, а при необходимости и создавать, программные продукты для решения поставленной задачи\n\n\n\nMetagenomics – part of the genomics studies considering not a single organisms, but the whole microbial communities living in different environments. Over 4.5 billion years bacteria are the dominant form of life on Earth. However, only 3-4% of them can be grown in laboratories, and we know almost nothing about others.\n\nA detailed analysis of the composition and functioning of complex communities allows to answer a lot ot questions related to human health, environmental protection, food storage and processing, the development of alternative energy sources, etc. The only way do it is processing of huge amounts of bioinformatics data obtained by sequencing of the total metagenomic DNA or individual genes.\n\nIn the course \"Introduction to bioinformatics: Metagenomics\" we will address the issues of sample preparation and metagenomic analysis; mathematical approaches used in such analysis; metagenome sequencing and assembling issues, annotation and application of the data.\n\nDuring the course, learners will be offered a project where they can apply acquired knowledge in practice. In this project, students will work with the real data, conduct independent analysis and draw conclusions about the composition and functions of the microbila community selected for the project.\n\nThe course \"Introduction to bioinformatics: Metagenomics\" has three main objectives:\n\n1. Give you outline of the problems the physicians, biologists, mathematicians and programmers meets studying complex microbial communities; methods to solve these problems; software and analytic platform designed to work with metagenomic data; mathematical algorithms underlying these programs\n2. Make you familiar with experimental skills for metagenomic analysis, the ability to plan an experiment, to assess the problem complexity and the required resources (wet lab and computational), to assess the quality of the obtained data for the given problem.\n3.

It tells the story of key campaigns in US history, and by doing so it investigates how politics changed over time—and how understanding the past sheds light on the current campaign. From the arrival of \"dirty politics\" to the impact of the \"digital revolution,\" the course looks at the historical background to some of the key phenomena that shaped the controversy-laden campaign of 2016.\n\nThe five elections that we'll investigate are among the most significant in American political history. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson won the presidency in a contest that encouraged politicians to reform the electoral college, the system by which presidents are still chosen. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted the outbreak of the Civil War. It's an election that helps us to understand the development of political parties. In 1968, the Vietnam War was a dominant concern for Americans, and yet foreign policy played a secondary role in Richard Nixon's victory. Twelve years later, in 1980, Ronald Reagan won an election that initiated a new era of conservatism. Finally, we'll turn our attention to the election that took Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, to the White House in 2008. Many saw the Obama's success not only as revealing the impact of the digital revolution on campaign politics, but also as signaling a turn to progressivism.  \n\nImage credits:\n\nCourse logo - \"Former President Truman holds a copy of the famous Chicago Daily Tribune paper declaring 'Dewey Defeats Truman'\" Harry S.

While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.  \n \nWorking through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"39iAT2nMEeSqESIAC44MZQ","slug":"bible-history","name":"The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The English for Research Publication Purposes Capstone, the specialization’s culminating project, is an opportunity for those who have completed all four courses of the specialization to apply what they have learned to write an original research paper for publication.

Answer: CAD software tools.  Learn how to build thesA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus in this first part of the course is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, the gate-level logic in these designs.  This is the first step of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout.    Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: Computational Boolean algebra, logic verification, and logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level).\n\nRecommended Background\nProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but it’s not necessary.  We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.e tools in this class.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"algorithms","domainId":"computer-science"}],"id":"nc5DINdVEeSQpiIAC2iNcA","slug":"vlsi-cad-logic","name":"VLSI CAD Part I: Logic"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"After a tremendous response from learners on Coursera, Berklee Online has created a Developing Your Musicianship specialization, and this course is the second course in the series.

Two (2) senior-level executives from leading organizations will provide detailed descriptions of ongoing leadership challenges that they are currently facing within their organizations. The challenges will be real and current. You will be asked to help the executives think through how best to approach and address their respective leadership challenges. Specifically, you will be tasked with drafting a memo to one of the executives outlining your recommendations for how best to address the leadership challenge. To offer effective advice and counsel, you will need to use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the fundamental issue(s), and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations. The memos will be evaluated based on how effectively you apply course concepts to diagnose the problem and how well you link your proposed solutions to the diagnosis. The best submissions will be sent to the executives for their review, and each executive will offer feedback that will then be shared with the entire class to advance everyone’s learning.\n\nThe second option is to identify your own leadership challenge (e.g., at work, at school, in your local community). You should be directly involved in the challenge, and the challenge must align with at least one topic from the specialization. You will develop a presentation where you use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the core leadership challenge and barriers to effective performance, and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations for your own leadership challenge.\n \nThe third option asks you to interview an executive of your choosing. In this interview, you will ask questions about the challenges faced by that executive with respect to leading people and teams, as well as the practices used by the executive to address his or her challenges.

It is fair to say work is a highly significant part of our lives. How do we find a job that suits us? How do we carry out our work in a productive way? How do we keep ourselves motivated and engaged at work? How can we effectively design work for other people?\n\nIf you have been thinking about at least some of these questions, then this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to use psychology to understand and improve the work life of yourself and those around you. We will be looking at key topic areas in work psychology that affect people's performance and well-being at work, including: individual differences in personality and cognitive ability; motivation at work; teamwork; leadership; work design and occupational health and safety. Collectively, these topics give you a broad understanding about work psychology both from an individual perspective and from a group-based and organisational perspective.  \n\nEach week, you will meet one or two world-leading professors in the field of work psychology. The professors will take you through the journey by introducing current theories and research evidence in respective topic areas. You will have lots of opportunities to engage in self-reflections and group discussions; you will also be given several self-assessments that help you understand your own psychological attributes and work characteristics.\n\nAn important note so that you are aware of the level of this course. This course is designed for anyone who has interest in Work / Organisational Psychology yet who has NOT completed formal training in Psychology. This is a foundational course that will introduce you to a number of key topics in Work Psychology so that you will understand this area of research and practice, and how you can apply some of the theories and findings into your own work life. This course is NOT designed for people who already have completed substantial formal studies or training in Work Psychology-related areas, such as leadership training. If you have done so, you will likely find this course less suitable for your level, and you might want to consider a more advanced Work Psychology course. \n\nWelcome to Psychology at Work and we wish you all the best in this learning journey!","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"psychology","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"id":"qXxuFBUnEeWhTg59fTWfpQ","slug":"work-psychology","name":"Psychology at Work"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"How does a good idea become a viable business opportunity?

Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.\n\nIn the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.\n\nYou can find a full syllabus and description of the course here:  http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GTOC-II-Syllabus.html \n\nThere is also a predecessor course to this one, for those who want to learn or remind themselves of the basic concepts of game theory: https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1  \n\nAn intro video can be found here:   http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/Game-Theory-2-Intro.mp4","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"}],"id":"n7Pp5hJfEea7Vw5aJ3DY6w","slug":"game-theory-2","name":"Game Theory II: Advanced Applications"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Once we have sequenced genomes in the previous course, we would like to compare them to determine how species have evolved and what makes them different.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we will compare two short biological sequences, such as genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or proteins.

By taking this course, you will be exposed to a range of problems at the foundations of theoretical computer science, and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to recognize, when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem, whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be able to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt to solve your own problem.

However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\n\nBut what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7. Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions. Some people say that these limited kinds of participation offer evidence that MOOCs suffer from low retention rates. Far from it – we say that any level of engagement is good engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, if you would like to take this course for credit at the University of Illinois, apply here: http://education.illinois.edu/online-offcampus/programs-degrees/ldl-online If you have already taken this course in Coursera, you can prepare a portfolio of work created there and request that this work is taken into account for your University of Illinois course.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"education"}],"id":"tYVJebfMEeSCoCIACwYbhg","slug":"elearning","name":"e-Learning Ecologies: Innovative Approaches to Teaching and Learning for the Digital Age"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course, participants will learn the foundations of accounting principles and financial analysis, develop an understanding of the links between these, and the measurement of value creation at the firm level.

We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leaders’ decisions.

Explains, in particular, why it is not possible to solve an equation of degree 5 or more in the same way as we solve quadratic or cubic equations. You will learn to compute Galois groups and (before that) study the properties of various field extensions.\n\nWe first shall survey the basic notions and properties of field extensions: algebraic, transcendental, finite field extensions, degree of an extension,  algebraic closure, decomposition field of a polynomial. \nThen we shall do a bit of commutative algebra (finite algebras over a field, base change via tensor product) and apply this  to study the notion of separability in some detail. \nAfter that we shall discuss Galois extensions and Galois correspondence and give many examples (cyclotomic extensions, finite fields, Kummer extensions, Artin-Schreier extensions, etc.). \nWe shall address the question of solvability of equations by radicals (Abel theorem). We shall also try to explain the relation to representations and to topological  coverings. \nFinally, we shall briefly discuss  extensions of rings (integral elemets, norms, traces, etc.) and explain how to use the reduction modulo primes to compute Galois groups.\n\nPREREQUISITES \nA first course in general algebra — groups, rings, fields, modules, ideals. Some knowledge of commutative algebra (prime and maximal ideals — first few pages of any book in commutative algebra) is welcome. For exercises we also shall need some elementary facts about groups and their actions on sets, groups of permutations and, marginally, \nthe statement of Sylow's theorems.\n\nASSESSMENTS\nA weekly test and two more serious exams in the middle and in the end of the course.

There's something here for everyone whether you are just looking for the basics or have years of experience in the dairy industry.\n\nThis is an eight-week course. Each week consists of four to nine video lectures, additional reading materials, and a multiple-choice questions quiz. Estimated study time is between three and five hours per week. Learners have the option to purchase a Course Certificate for 49.00 USD.

Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?\n\nMost milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.\n\nIn this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.\n\nCourse lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese; PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week. The Dairy MOOC team thanks Dr. Antonio Branco (Universidade Estadual de Maringá, Brazil) and Ms. Yuanyuan Zhang (Pennsylvania State University) for translating the lecture materials.\n\nCourse Sponsors\n\nThis course was supported by the generous contributions of Innovation Center for US Dairy at Silver Level and Pancosma North America, RP Nutrients, Inc. and Arm and Hammer, which provided funding support at a Bronze Level.

How we should treat each other and our organizations in global and local contexts is the topic of  this course.  Business ethics and corporate responsibility are inherent in global commerce. Commerce is about markets, and markets entail exchanges between people and groups of people. So commerce is about human relationships, and indeed, it could not be otherwise. \n\nOne of the important challenges in global business is working out the extent of these obligations in the interrelationships between businesses and the particular local cultures in which that business operates. The ethical issues arising from these engagements, the kinds of values-based considerations out of which an organization negotiates with local concerns, and how an organization can be both an enabler of economic value-added while respecting cultural differences will be topics of this course. \n\nUpon successful completion of this course you will be able to: \n•\tBecome morally sensitive to ethical dilemmas in global commerce \n•\tIdentify ethical issues in global business  \n•\tMaster stakeholder analysis  \n•\tAddress issues from more than one point of view \n•\tUse a well-reasoned process by which to arrive at ethically-defensible decisions \n•\tEvaluate good and weak arguments \n•\tDefend your conclusions  \n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

El primero estudia la derivada, y el segundo, la integral, siendo este momento en el que aparece el Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo (TFC) para establecer la relación entre ambos conceptos. En el presente curso vamos a hacer una diferencia: introduciremos la derivada y la integral como conceptos relacionados desde un principio. \n\nVamos a iniciar con la interpretación del Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo, con esto nos referimos a descubrir su significado real en la solución de problemas. Llegaremos a asociar con él la actividad práctica de calcular el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Habiendo realizado esta interpretación, los conceptos de derivada e integral se verán relacionados desde un principio, lo que te permitirá predecir el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Las nociones fundamentales de derivada e integral las identificaremos con las ideas de “razón de cambio” y de “acumulación del cambio”, y el TFC nos proveerá de la estrategia de solución.\n \nRecordarás que la Matemática Elemental incluye el Álgebra, la Geometría y la Geometría Analítica. Podemos decir que éstas son Matemáticas que estudian lo estático. En cambio, la Matemática Superior, que incluye el Cálculo, estudia lo dinámico.

Costos, temperaturas, poblaciones, velocidades, energías, capitales de inversión, longitudes, etc., son algunos ejemplos de esto. En este curso podrás entender al Cálculo como una estrategia de solución para el estudio del cambio y diferenciarlo de las Matemáticas Elementales, aunque utilice de ellas bastante información.\n \nAl finalizar este curso podrás:\n\nDescribir de qué manera los modelos matemáticos polinomial, exponencial natural, y trigonométricos (seno y coseno), son una construcción que responde a esta práctica de predicción. Los verás a todos ellos surgir de esta práctica cuando una magnitud real particular cumple ciertas condiciones en su “razón de cambio” con respecto a la magnitud de la que depende. \n\nUtilizar la introducción de procesos infinitos (¡no imposibles!) en la construcción de la respuesta de predicción, con ello entenderás por qué se habla de Matemática Superior y de un pensamiento matemático avanzado.\n\nValorar una forma de pensar diferente, donde nuestro razonamiento matemático trascienda la sola manipulación de fórmulas algebraicas.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"}],"id":"_mOFSBtlEeWP9g4JMjGIiQ","slug":"calculo-diferencial","name":"Cálculo Diferencial e Integral unidos por el Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"La tecnología forma parte de nuestro día a día, es algo tan naturalizado, que muchas veces no somos conscientes de como esto llega a nuestras manos, cuantas personas lo tuvieron antes que nosotros y cuál es el impacto.

L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui avec l'essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul. Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels proposés par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les développements contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des différenciations masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales développés en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons entre nations ? \nPour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caractérisée par la taille, par l'agrégation des logements, les divisions différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entremêler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent différents processus d'intégration : la ville matérielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d'éducation ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie de la ville : la division du travail, l'échelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce.....\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités, le logement, le gouvernement, l'intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l'enracinement, sur le développement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le développement économique urbain.\nToutes les vidéos produites par Sciences Po pour ce MOOC sont sous licence Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nPlan du cours\n\nSemaine #1 : Introduction, définitions, questions urbaines et l'utilisation de modèles\nSemaine #2 : Les villes européennes et le modèle d'intégration wébérien\nSemaine #3 : Les villes coloniales et post coloniales\nSemaine #4 : Les villes industrielles (et les villes socialistes) et les modèles marxistes\nSemaine #5 : Les métropoles américaines et l'école de Chicago, \nSemaine #6 : Les post-métropoles, fragments et différences\nSemaine #7 : Les villes mondiales et les mégacités\nSemaine #8 : Les villes intelligentes et la sociologie des sciences et technologies","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"Hfv9gzTZEea_2AoR0P8XnQ","slug":"developpement-urbain","name":"Cities are back in town : sociologie urbaine pour un monde globalisé"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course you will learn how to design lesson plans around the needs of your ELL students and their language level through the analysis of content language and cognitive demands.

We are not just content with analyzing the many elements still visible of the ancient city.

On space walks and through windows, course instructor Ron Garan was struck by the stunning beauty of the Earth from space but sobered by knowing how much needed to be done to help this troubled planet. And yet on the International Space Station, Garan, a former fighter pilot, was working work side by side with Russians, who only a few years before were “the enemy.” If fifteen nations could collaborate on one of the most ambitious, technologically complicated undertakings in history, surely we can apply that kind of cooperation and innovation toward creating a better world. \n\nIn this course Garan will convey what it was like learning to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known. But more importantly, the course will address how we can apply the orbital perspective here at home, embracing new partnerships and processes to promote peace and combat hunger, thirst, poverty, and environmental destruction. This course is a call to action for each of us to care for the most important space station of all: planet Earth.\n\nThe course will also involve participation in the Earthrise-2068 project. Working with people from around the world, students will help craft a vision of our future in the year 2068.

Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"id":"e9PicBJhEeaoZBKRisF_Dw","slug":"technology-of-music-production","name":"The Technology of Music Production"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"离散数学是计算机科学的基础理论，离散结构的基础知识和逻辑思维的形式化是信息技术类学生的基本功，离散数学的基本概念是理科专业学生进行信息类课程学习的重要基础。\n\n本课程介绍计算机科学和信息技术理论基础的概念和思想方法，介绍数理逻辑、集合论、图论、抽象代数和形式语言与自动机等各部分的基本概念，介绍离散数学基本概念和空间信息技术之间的联系与结合，培养学生理解和掌握离散数学基本概念，采用形式化方法分析问题，并能自觉运用逻辑分析、结构层次分析和同构类比等思想方法解决问题的能力。","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"algorithms","domainId":"computer-science"},{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"}],"id":"VXrdLODREeWGtArzEGZPmw","slug":"dmathgen","name":"离散数学概论 Discrete Mathematics Generality"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"How did life emerge on Earth?

Websites crash, calendar not synchronising, or even a power blackout. Of course you have! But did you know that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within a system or between systems? Depending on the system, the impact of software failures can be huge, even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of lives. Software, and in particular the communication between software-intensive systems, is very complex and very difficult to get right. However, we _need_ dependability in the systems we use, directly or indirectly, to support us in our everyday lives.\n\nSystem Validation helps you to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound. It also enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful; systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also much easier to maintain and adapt. System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. The techniques put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors. \n\nThis first course ’Automata and behavioural equivalences', builds the foundation of the subsequent courses, showing you how to look at system behaviour as state machines. It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward, but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely. Especially, in the combination with hiding of behaviour, equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems, far more effective than simulation or testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct. Such models form an excellent basis for the production of concise, reliable and maintainable software.\n\nThis course is part I of the set of courses for System Validation. System Validation, as a set of courses, is part of a larger EIT Digital online programme called 'Internet of Things through Embedded Systems'.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"design-and-product","domainId":"computer-science"},{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"id":"pCa5-xauEeWEjBINzvDOWw","slug":"automata-system-validation","name":"System Validation: Automata and behavioural equivalences"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course will explore the forces that led to the 9/11 attacks and the policies the United States adopted in response.

Public and private stakeholders who are active in this field must develop new ways to better manage the water cycle \"as a whole\".\n\nThe objective of this MOOC is to develop an understanding of the problems related to water management. Firstly, this course will define a resource and, more specifically, the resource of water. It will look at how water is used and the activities associated with it as well as any potential conflicts. The course will look at water management in detail through the analysis of the different types of rights and obligations associated with, for example, the development of a multi-sectorial regulation system or a watershed management approach.\n\nBy the end of this course, our aim is to enable you to:\n1) Identify the main issues and strategies linked to water resource management\n2) Acquire the key reading material needed to understand the many variables (environmental, institutional and political) which affect water and which, in terms of management, may require adjustment.\n\nThis course was developed by the Geneva Water Hub. Alongside researchers from the University of Geneva from a range of faculties, researchers from other universities and research centres will be involved in this course. Practitioners who deal daily with the political dimension of water management will also input into the course.\n\nThis MOOC is designed for all those interested in the water sector. Prior training is not necessary to follow our program. The findings presented in this course can be easily reapplied to different contexts and to different scales of analysis.\n\nThis MOOC is supported by the Geneva Water Hub and the University of Geneva along with the MOOC in « Ecosystem Services: a Method for Sustainable Development » (www.coursera.org/learn/ecosystem-services) and the one in \"International Water Law\" (www.coursera.org/learn/droit-eau).

You can also compare Russian approach with international standards enshrined in relevant treaties and discover problematic arears of trademark protection in the Russia.\n\nThis course is on legal regulation of trademark protection in Russia. It explains the process of acquiring trademark in Russia, alternatives to trademark protection (such as firm names, trade names, names of origins), requirements for trademark validity, conditions under which trademarks are protected in Russia, scope of excusive trademark rights protection, peculiarities of assignment and licensing practice in Russia. The course also focuses on issues of trademark infringement, criteria applied by the Russian courts and relevant practice of the Russian Intellectual Property Court. It describes different remedies available to the trademark holders, including calculation of statutory damages under the Russian law for trademark infringement. \n\nRussian trademark legislation and case law do not have long historical roots. This is the reason why this area of the Russian law may be characterized as very dynamic. Examples will be given to illustrate successful legal solutions (for example, trademark protection in domain names, exhaustion of trademark rights) and ongoing search for proper and balanced regulation (for example, regulation of parallel imports, antitrust regulation in trademark law, application of fair use doctrine o trademarks).","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"marketing"}],"id":"IEGB9xHcEeaRgQ4evS8KlQ","slug":"russian-trademark-law","name":"Russian Trademark Law in Global Perspective"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course will highlight the most interesting experiments within the field of psychology, discussing the implications of those studies for our understanding of the human mind and human behavior.

Il s’agit, en partant de la compréhension de leur formation, de leur organisation et de leur fonctionnement, d’examiner les modes d’intervention qui visent leur revalorisation et intégration dans les structures formelles des villes qui les accueillent.\n\nLa croissance rapide des villes s’est accompagnée, sur l’ensemble des continents, de mécanismes parfois déroutants de production urbaine qui ont mis à mal les équilibres territoriaux et sociaux des agglomérations. \n\nA  l’heure actuelle, près d’un milliard de personnes dans le monde, vivent dans des quartiers précaires, en raison des mauvaises conditions d’accueil et de la pénurie de logements. Cela est particulièrement vrai des villes africaines, où la croissance s’opère principalement en périphérie, par la création de quartiers précaires où se concentre la pauvreté urbaine.\n\nL’existence et l’extension de ce type de quartiers interrogent sur la capacité de ces villes à intégrer les populations pauvres, en même temps qu’elles révèlent les limites des politiques urbaines à planifier et réguler le développement des grandes agglomérations. La question est devenue si préoccupante que la question de la restructuration des quartiers précaires dépasse aujourd’hui le cadre strict d’une intervention physique pour se poser comme une question de développement à part entière.\n\nQuelle lecture peut-on faire de l’existence et de la prolifération des quartiers précaires en Afrique?

Les participants bénéficieront de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience de terrain, sur les opportunités et les défis que présentent la mise en place et la maintenance d’infrastructures affectées aux services publics par des PPP efficaces.\n\nLe cours comprend des films vidéo, des lectures, des questionnaires et autres matériels d’apprentissage conçus et enseignés par des experts notamment de l’Université d’Harvard, l’Université John Hopkins, L’université de la Sorbonne, l’Université Panthéon-Assas, la Facilité Africaine de Soutien Juridique, la Banque d’Investissement Européenne, le Fond Monétaire International, l’Agence Française de Développement, et la Banque mondiale.\n\nCe cours vous apportera ce dont vous avez besoin pour mieux comprendre les PPP, que vous soyez un membre de la société civile, du grand public, un praticien, un fonctionnaire d’état ou un décideur politique.\n\n~~ A propos du cours\n\nPartout dans le monde et en particulier dans les pays en développement, les gouvernements rencontrent des difficultés pour mettre en place et maintenir les infrastructures nécessaires à la croissance économique de leur pays et à la prestation de services publics de base aux citoyens. Les partenariats public-privés (PPP) sont un des outils que les gouvernements peuvent utiliser pour contribuer à la mise en place de meilleurs services publics. Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans la réduction du déficit d’infrastructures. Le cours présentera les difficultés et les défis rencontrés lors de la sélection des projets jusqu’à leur mise en œuvre. Ainsi, vous améliorerez votre compréhension sur l’opportunité ou non de recourir à un PPP pour développer un projet d’infrastructure.\n\nDurant ce cours de quatre semaines, vous bénéficierez de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience transactionnelle pour approfondir vos connaissances.\nPlusieurs ressources seront proposées chaque semaine, tels des films vidéos d’experts et de praticiens, des lectures obligatoires et facultatives, un questionnaire à choix multiples portant sur le thème de la semaine, et des exercices pour parfaire vos compétences d’analyse, de réflexion et de communication.\n\n~~ Semaine 1: Réduire le déficit d’infrastructure : le rôle des PPP\n\nCe premier module explique comment et pourquoi l’expertise et les ressources du secteur privé peuvent être mobilisées par les gouvernements pour contribuer à la réduction de leur déficit d’infrastructures. Ce module introduit le concept de PPP, ses caractéristiques, et les types de modalités contractuelles reflétant le degré de participation du secteur privé. Les PPP ne regroupent pas tous les contrats entre une personne publique et une personne privée, et ce module définit également ce que n’est pas un PPP. Des exemples d’échecs ou de PPP réussis seront utilisés pour illustrer les conditions optimales pour réussir des projets, et pour souligner la nécessité d’une analyse précise, ainsi que l’importance de la durabilité, la participation des acteurs et la bonne gouvernance des PPP.\n\n~~ Semaine 2: Prendre les bonnes décisions: les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPP\n\nCe module examine les principes, valeurs et défis que requièrent la mise en place d’un cadre facilitant l’exécution des projets de PPP dans l’optique d’améliorer les services publics et l’investissement en infrastructure. Vous bénéficierez des leçons apprises lors de la réalisation des PPP et de leur incorporation dans des cadres législatifs efficaces. La semaine 2 vous apportera également une vue d’ensemble des différentes étapes du cycle de vie des PPP et approfondira la première phase : l’identification et la sélection des projets.\n\n~~ Semaine 3: Susciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié: la passation des PPP\n\nCe module débute par une discussion sur la nécessité de développer des arguments commerciaux solides pour transformer un projet en PPP, et insiste sur l’importance de la structure du partenariat pour garantir une répartition des risques appropriée entre les commanditaires privés, les bailleurs de fonds, et le gouvernement. Ce module passe en revue les différentes étapes du processus d’appel d’offres et explique les défis rencontrés pour parvenir à un bon résultat, et explique le rôle des bailleurs qui sont souvent des acteurs clés dans la structuration de l’appel d’offre.\n\n~~ Semaine 4: Obtenir un partenariat réussi: la mise en œuvre du PPP \n\nCe module présente les aspects fondamentaux et les difficultés dans la gestion des contrats, tels que l’application de l’exécution du contrat, et sa renégociation ou sa résiliation. Enfin, ce module couvre la gestion des offres non sollicitées qui, bien qu’en dehors d’un processus de mise en concurrence, peuvent être une source d’idées innovantes.\n\n~~ Comment bénéficier au maximum de ce cours? Interagir et approfondir\n\nLes participants peuvent choisir l’un des deux parcours « Compréhension des PPP » ou « Politique et Pratique des PPP » en fonction de leur intérêt et objectifs professionnels. Le parcours « Compréhension des PPP » vise les personnes ayant un intérêt général pour les PPP et désirant améliorer leur compréhension du sujet. Le parcours permet aux auditeurs de se familiariser avec les concepts de base des PPP et leurs principaux outils, et offre la possibilité de communiquer avec des professionnels et des praticiens. Le parcours « Politique et Pratique des PPP » est destiné aux auditeurs souhaitant obtenir une meilleure connaissance des PPP et approfondir leur apprentissage.\n\nQuel que soit le parcours choisi, des questions seront soulevées et des points clés seront discutés sur le forum Coursera tout au long de la semaine. Nous espérons qu’en plus du forum de discussion, vous vous connecterez sur des réseaux sociaux (tels Twitter et Google+) pour profiter pleinement de votre participation au cours.

To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming—if done well—can be transformative for organizers and participants.\n\nCourse Level Objectives:\nUnderstand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities. \nDescribe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in a complex and contested environment.\nCompare legislative, governance, and public accountability and expectations in relation to contemporary issues in higher education.\nAnalyze the strategic diversity planning process and documents of a selected institution. \nRecommend innovations and opportunities for transformational change at various levels of the ecological model using the strategic diversity planning process as a tool.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"id":"ebRQ7fLtEean7ApB_Olrug","slug":"leading-for-equity-diversity-inclusion","name":"Leading for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Hurricanes: What's Next? is part of the University of Michigan's Teach-Out series.

For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about that system’s future.\n\nHowever, there are some systems that defy this notion. Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.\n\nThis course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected, surprising behaviors.\n\nNote: The fractal image (Sierpinkski Triangle) depicted on the course home page was generated by a software application called XaoS 3.4, which is distributed by the Free Software Foundation under a GNU General Public License.\n\nUpon completing this course, you will be able to:\n1.

Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"0mS2lqJaEeW1Bw7HN8tFsw","slug":"economic-growth-part-1","name":"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part I -The Role of the State"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The teacher’s work becomes meaningful when it is informed by research and theories of learning, and their relationship to actual practice.

This course aims to expand our “Bayesian toolbox” with more general models, and computational techniques to fit them. In particular, we will introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which allow sampling from posterior distributions that have no analytical solution. We will use the open-source, freely available software R (some experience is assumed, e.g., completing the previous course in R) and JAGS (no experience required). We will learn how to construct, fit, assess, and compare Bayesian statistical models to answer scientific questions involving continuous, binary, and count data. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience.

What is your dog expressing when he yawns or wags his tail? Understanding your cat and dog’s behaviour and the way they communicate with you, will enable you to better understand their needs and strengthen your relationship with them.\n\nThis MOOC is divided into five topics, the appliance of science; behaviour and body language, senses and perception; challenges for the human-animal relationship, including pet problem behaviour; and how to improve the quality of life for cats and dogs in our care.\n\nAt the start of the course we ask you to consider what you feel is important to your cat/dog and what your cat/dog means to you? We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.  \n\nFrom our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!\n\nFinally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us. We ask, what can we do to be more responsible pet owners and to ensure the welfare of all cats and dogs in society? This MOOC explores different scientifically validated methods that can help you to better understand your pet, to enrich their lives and help you to be a more educated and confident pet owner.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the course!","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"animals-and-veterinary-science","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"id":"PKJBXN8SEeWxQg6ioCYbHw","slug":"cats-and-dogs","name":"The Truth About Cats and Dogs"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"“Give me liberty, or give me death:” Remembering Patrick Henry, the Forgotten Founder\n\n\tPatrick Henry was enormously popular during the American Revolution. Even Thomas Jefferson, who over time developed a deep loathing of Henry (some would say jealousy), had to admit that “it is not now easy to say what we should have done without Patrick Henry.” Edmund Randolph, a patriot leader in his own right, explained that “It was Patrick Henry … awakening the genius of his country, and binding a band of patriots together to hurl defiance at the tyranny of so formidable a nation as Great Britain.” \n\tYet, today, Patrick Henry is ill-remembered; most Americans might recall at best perhaps a snippet from a famous speech: “give me liberty, or give me death.” The reasons for our historic forgetfulness are several: after the Revolution, Henry chose to oppose ratification of the U.S. Constitution, believing that it created a distant and too-powerful government, and he refused proffered position in George Washington’s administration, diminishing his historic memory. Equally important, Henry died in 1799 shortly after a political campaign in which, at Washington’s behest, he opposed Jefferson’s and James Madison’s ill-advised radical states’ rights attack on the U.S. government, and Jefferson spent the next twenty-six years systematically attacking Henry’s legacy.\n\tPatrick Henry, who helped to ignite a revolution, deserves better. This course will explore how he over¬came challenges to reach the pinnacle of Virginia politics and unite Americans behind a challenge to Britain – the eighteenth century’s super-power, why he opposed the U.S. Constitu¬tion, and why he then came out of retirement to defend the people’s Constitution against the attacks of Jefferson and Madison. \n\tParticipants should evaluate Henry’s role in proclaiming a revolution and consider whether he had an equally important role in saving it. The course should also develop an improved appreciation for the complex political, economic, and religious forces that shaped the early republic. As a biographical course, it also demonstrates how personalities play an important role in even the most foundational national history.\n\n\nImage Attribution:\nThe background image for this webpage is Patrick Henry before the Virginia House of Burgesses by Peter F. Rothermel (1851) with special thanks to the owner, the Patrick Henry Memorial Foundation. The painting of Patrick Henry's 1765 \"Caesar had his Brutus\" speech (discussed in the second lecture) is entirely romanticized -- neither Henry nor the House of Burgesses looked at all like this -- but it does show that hagiography of Henry, almost god-like veneration, began shortly after this death.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"iYYp3BipEeeAuQ5XyvTfVA","slug":"henry","name":"Patrick Henry: Forgotten Founder"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Decía Steve Jobs que “todo el mundo debería aprender a programar un ordenador porque esto te ayuda a pensar”.

His intellectual importance resides in his response to the ecological crisis by bringing together the humanities and science in an evolutionary narrative.  In addition, he articulated the need for the moral participation of the world religions in addressing environmental issues.  He came to this realization largely through his study of cosmologies embedded within religious traditions.  Sensing the significance of these stories as “functional cosmologies” he explored the widespread influence that these stories transmitted through a tradition, for example, in rituals, ethics, and subsistence practices.\n\nUpcoming sessions\nMay 8, 2017 - June 26, 2017\nJune 5, 2017 - July 24, 2017\nJuly 3, 2017 - August 21, 2017\nJuly 31, 2017 - September 18, 2017\nAugust 28, 2017 - October 16, 2017\nSeptember 25, 2017 - November 13, 2017","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"id":"WXt3PEUsEeaDRhLb8lAaNw","slug":"thomas-berry","name":"The Worldview of Thomas Berry:  The Flourishing of the Earth Community"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"There are three orienting facts that render mass incarceration in the United States an ethical problem worthy of our deep consideration. First, the rate of incarceration has grown dramatically over the last 40 years so that today there are 2.2 million people in prison or jail, and another 5 million on probation or parole. This means that 1/32 adults in the USA are under state supervision. Second, the application of incarceration is disproportionately applied to the poor, people of color, and other vulnerable populations. Research shows that 85-90% of those in the criminal justice system fall below the poverty line, and the experience of incarceration only impoverishes people further. The consequences of having a criminal record are harsh and debilitating, ranging from family disruption, social alienation, and disenfranchisement. In these ways and others, the current situation of crime and punishment represents a dramatic moral challenge. Finally, victims of crime are themselves poorly served by the current system, often ignored or sidelined in the machinery of punishment.\n\nThis course seeks to discover alternatives to the current systems of crime and punishment in order to imagine a more inclusive, just and moral society.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"S5Y40cL5Eea6CwrxGAW0VA","slug":"massincarceration","name":"Justice, Mercy and Mass Incarceration"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is designed to provide a basic understanding of financial statements with an emphasis on the income statement.

Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n\nAbout the instructor: Dr. Larry Lagerstrom is the Director of Academic Programs at Stanford University’s Center for Professional Development, which offers graduate certificates in subjects such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, data mining, nanotechnology, innovation, and management science.

We recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations, business cases and battles  in an effort to truly understand constructing a convincing argument.\n\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations. But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call a ‘transferrable skill’.\n\nThe course requires an academic approach, but no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from the experience. \n\nWhat is a policy advice?\nIn its simplest form, a policy advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to adopt your position and to take action on your advice. \n\nWhat advice can I give?\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with others in a similar position.\n\n On the other hand, you might be open for suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example, you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these techniques to their favourite topics.\n\nWhat will I learn?\nThe project-based course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth. During the whole course experience you will learn to:\n•\tFrame a starting position for your own research\n•\tUse search engines to locate materials required for your advice\n•\tExplore ‘academic’ data-bases\n•\tAnnotate your sources correctly\n•\tTarget your research for statistical data\n•\tChoose a visualisation for your statistical data \n•\tConstruct an argument in a logical manner\n•\tBuild up the logic in each paragraph \n•\tConduct a SWOT analysis\n•\tConduct a Risk Analysis\n•\tPresent the materials in a position paper\n•\tConvert the position paper to a policy advice\n•\tRecognise the policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly \n•\tWrite a powerful and effective PowerPoint presentation\n•\tPlace your project in the ‘real world’ context of the policy-cycle\n•\tAnd ... Discover a great, great deal about your chosen topic.\n\nHow much time will the course take?\nThe lecture materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more than an one hour for each module. \nThe project-time depends on the degree of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections, then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\n\nAbout Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way.

La deuxième partie du MOOC illustre l’approche thermodynamique par une série d’applications présentées par des spécialistes provenant de diverses institutions partenaires du réseau RESCIF. \n\nL’objectif du cours est la compréhension et la capacité de mise en application des concepts fondamentaux de la thermodynamique. Après la présentation du premier et deuxième principe de la thermodynamique, l’exposé abordera les questions d’irréversibilité ainsi que les potentiels thermodynamiques. \n\nAprès l’établissement de ces bases conceptuelles, leurs applications à l’ingénierie tels que les transferts thermiques, la calorimétrie et les transitions de phases, seront traitées. Ensuite le point de vue de la chimie sera présenté pour aborder la conversion de l’énergie chimique en électricité.

When it comes to health information, most Americans have the ability to read and write at the fifth-grade level. This inter-professional course aims to give health professionals the tools needed to improve upon their health literacy and communication skills.\n\nThis inter-professional course will help educate a variety of health professionals about health literacy efforts and improved communication skills. It will require your active participation in creating health literate interactions at various organizational levels. This course will provide the opportunity to reinforce existing opportunities to work together as a multidisciplinary team or fill a gap if you haven’t had an opportunity to do so yet!\n\nPlease copy and paste the following link into your browser to view our course overview video. http://tinyurl.com/jepeg5e \n\nUpon completion of the course, you will be able to:\n\n1.     Define health literacy and how it applies to all health disciplines. \n\n2.     List the varied factors that influence health literacy and health communication. \n\n3.     Identify who is affected by health literacy and health communication. \n\n4.     Recognize the consequences of limited health literacy and poor health communication. \n\n5.     Determine the stakeholders in health literacy and health communication. \n\n6.     Recognize the role of health literacy in meeting core health service across disciplines. \n\n7.      Apply strategies to improve health literacy at the group, organizational, community, and policy levels\n\nIn addition to these course objectives, it is key to the success of the student that participants understand their responsibilities of working as a part of an inter-professional health care team. The basis of patient-centered care and the foundation of the medical home model is that health professionals will learn and implement skills to meet the community’s health needs in the context of the community’s daily lives—which is their reality! That includes recognizing the social determinants of health, such as complex social, economic, environmental, and political factors, that impact both the public’s wellness and their health literacy, too.\n\nOne initial step – an optional but recommended prerequisite to beginning this online course – is to first complete the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s self-directed online training, “Health Literacy for Public Health Professionals”. It provides a good foundation about health literacy in three brief, interactive lessons which will take about 1.5-2 hours to complete.\n\nWe are also using the Institute of Medicine’s Roundtable on Health Literacy discussion paper, “Ten Attributes of Health Literate Health Care Organizations” as a guide.  This online course will assist its participants in understanding that health literacy needs to be an organizational value and embraced as part of the organization’s core business. \n\nA phrase that we often like to use is “help a person connect the dots”. By this we mean we need to make sure that understanding of health information exists. An example of this would be thinking if someone is advised they need to take a medication, or told they need to change daily choices and behaviors to improve health that it will simply happen as directed. But, there are many necessary steps, strategies, and skills in communication for the advice being given to actually happen.  Often, current health professionals and health care settings often assume that “one size fits all” when it comes to communicating health messages.  This course will focus on some approaches to becoming a health literate health care organization by using scenarios with actors based on patient experiences, by also letting patients share their experiences in their own words, and by offering suggestions for improvement in health communication.\n\nWe hope you join us and become an agent of change both in your own discipline and as a member of an inter-professional team in health care organizations going forward!","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"education"}],"id":"dpUAfhO6EeajWgpXwy6yqw","slug":"health-literacy","name":"Health Literacy and Communication for Health Professionals"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Over 500,000 people in the United States and over 8 million people worldwide are dying every year from cancer.

It starts by talking about energy itself and where it comes from. This includes how much we have, who has it, who uses it, and what that all means. The video clips are produced in a fast-paced multimedia format during which Professor Ruzic throws in fun and demonstrations. There are multiple-choice questions to check your understanding and some more in-depth exercises to guide you deeper into the subject.\n\nAfter explaining the main things we use energy for – our cars and electronics! – fossil fuels are examined in detail. Want to really learn about fracking or pipelines? Watch these segments. The environmental effects of fossil fuels are taught as well. Global warming, acid rain, and geoengineering all are in this part of the course. Part of their solution is too. Renewables follow, with clips on solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels, etc. You’ll even see Professor Ruzic in a corn field and in the middle of a stream showing how you could dam it up.\n\nFinally, nuclear power is taught in detail – how it really works and what happens when it doesn’t work, as in Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, as well as how we are making it today, which is shown here without political preconceptions. In this course, economics takes center stage. People will ultimately do whatever costs the least, so energy policy is most effective when it is targeted at the user’s wallet.\n\nThroughout the course there are 24 segments on “How Things Work.\" These guides to everyday life are tremendously varied, covering everything from fireworks to making beer to what happens backstage at a theater.

We have two courses before this one, called “Object-Oriented Design” and “Design Patterns”. These are foundational to Software Architecture, but you can take this course as a stand-alone one if it suits you and your goals!\n\nIn this course we will talk about software architecture. Architecture is the high-level form of the software design, so we are no longer talking about objects and classes, but components. Components are software units - subroutines, classes, functions, etc. - that are grouped on the basis of separation of concerns. The way that these components are arranged, and the interactions between them, are called the architecture.\n\nWe will discuss the ways these architectures are represented, both in UML and other visual tools, and introduce the most common architectures, their qualities, and tradeoffs. In the last module, we will talk about how architectures are evaluated; what makes a good architecture? how can it be made better? We'll also talk about how the architecture touches on the process of software development. All the while you'll be practicing these architectures yourself and gaining hands-on experience.\n\nWe have estimated that you will need about 4 hours per week to get the most out of this course, so it is hard work, but worth the effort. Good luck!\n\nUpon completion of this course, a learner will be able to…\t\n• Compare and contrast the components, connections, protocols, topologies, constraints, tradeoffs, and variations of different types of architectural styles used in the design of applications and systems (e.g., main program and subroutine, object-oriented, interpreters, pipes and filters, database centric, event-based).\t\n• Describe the properties of layered and n-tier architectures.\t\n• Create UML ipackage, component, and deployment diagrams to express the architectural structure of a system.\t\n• Explain the behaviour of a system using UML activity diagrams.\t\n• Document a multi-application system with a layered architecture.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"},{"subdomainId":"mobile-and-web-development","domainId":"computer-science"}],"id":"07aYjGy8EeeB2gpod3ECDg","slug":"software-architecture","name":"Software Architecture"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course teaches you the simple principles expert managers use to improve and motivate employee performance.

It start in its first module by introducing the key macroeconomic variables and explaining how they are defined and measured in order to enable the students to interpret macroeconomic data properly.\n\nIn the second module, the course offers a perspective for separating out various parts of the economy driven by different processes and for combining those components to develop a richer view of the whole. In particular, it applies this approach to the analysis of the relationship of the trade deficit with the budget deficit and private savings, offering insights about some key determinants of the balance of payments.\n\nThe third and fourth modules focus on the analyses of the foreign currency and money markets to provide fundamental models of the interest rate and exchange rate determination. They also discuss how these variables interact with each other and with the macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy and the expectations about the future trends in the economy. These analyses lay the foundation for more comprehensive models of the macroeconomy in the next course of the Managerial Economics and Business Analysis Specialization.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tSystematically assess the national and international economic environment in which you live and work.\n•\tAnalyze macroeconomic issues using key tools.\n•\tBe a more effective professional in your line of activity.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\n\nThree features of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"FuHL-RuOEeSduyIAC0iV4g","slug":"money-banking","name":"Economics of Money and Banking"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This is a course to help you write effective business emails in English.

It also aims at providing students, who already have a technical background in energy science or engineering, with the broad global view of energy issues that will allow them to better understand the social, economic and political impact of their technical knowledge.\n\n\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR :\n\nGiacomo Luciani\n\nScientific Advisor for the Master in International Energy at the Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA) Sciences Po, Giacomo Luciani is also Adjunct Professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva and Director of the Executive Master in International Oil and Gas Leadership. For the period 2010-13 he was appointed Princeton University Global Scholar, attached to the Woodrow Wilson School and the Department of Near Eastern Studies. His research focuses on the political economy of the Middle East and North Africa and on global energy issues.\n\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND :\n\nThe course requires no special scientific, mathematical or economic background; all key concepts are clearly and elementarily explained. It is expected that it will be of interest to undergraduate and graduate students in schools where an equivalent course is not offered (this being the case for the vast majority of schools).\n\n\nUSPC\nSorbonne Paris Cité\nSupported by Université Sorbonne Paris Cité\n\n\nIDEX\nInvestissements d'Avenir\nFunded by Investissements d'Avenir - 'ANR.\n\nInfo : \nCourse content : Licence Creative Commons BY NC SA","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"YjCOKcQTEeWI6BLH_IXMZw","slug":"global-energy","name":"Politics and Economics of International Energy"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"La mayoría de las personas, en algún momento de la vida, hemos experimentado inseguridad para hablar acerca de sexualidad con niñas, niños, estudiantes, pareja o colegas.

To gain the most relevant knowledge from these courses, learners should have taken a basic accounting course prior to this Specialization (which can be done through Coursera courses, such as any accounting course from the Fundamentals of Accounting Specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/accounting-fundamentals). This Specialization focuses on accounting concepts, principles and theory with an emphasis on problems that arise in applying these concepts for external reporting purposes.  Specific emphasis is placed on measurement of assets, liabilities, equities and income, as well as disclosure of additional information that may assist users understand the financial reports.  \n\nAfter a brief introduction to the course, we will spend time understanding the overall financial accounting structure and standards as well as review the fundamental accounting process used to prepare the financial statements, which will establish a framework for the study of the concepts in the remaining courses in the Financial Reporting Specialization. In this course, we will begin our review of key information included in the Balance Sheet and Income Statement and their related financial disclosures. The Statement of Cash Flows will be introduced briefly with more discussion to follow in later courses of the Specialization.  Also, we will provide a cursory review of key concepts involving time value of money as we will finish this course with focus on revenue recognition, including discussion of the new revenue standard.  We will review the general approach for recognizing revenue, special issues affecting revenue recognition including long-term construction contracts.

This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWe encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look. Politicians, salespeople, and children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want us to think. Think Again: Fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to think.\n\nIn this course, you will learn about fallacies. Fallacies are arguments that suffer from one or more common but avoidable defects:  equivocation, circularity, vagueness, etc. It’s important to learn about fallacies so that you can recognize them when you see them, and not be fooled by them. It’s also important to learn about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious arguments yourself.\n\nSuggested Readings\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 13-17, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"},{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"}],"id":"wywOj9ZqEeWoww7Hc7148Q","slug":"logical-fallacies","name":"Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course focuses on the key concepts you need in order to effectively integrate technology into your teaching, without letting it overshadow language learning.

Он основан на концепциях современной финансовой теории и выходит далеко за рамки интерпретации финансовой отчетности компании.  \n\nПрименяя принципы универсальной финансовой теории, мы, тем не менее, отразим и специфику российского рынка капитала, который относится к группе развивающихся рынков. Курс основан на изучении публичных компаний,  однако его концепции применимы к компаниям любой организационно-правовой формы.\n\nМы сфокусируемся на анализе ключевых корпоративных решений: решений о привлечении капитала и решений об инвестициях. Инвестиционные решения – это выбор компанией проектов для долгосрочных вложений. Наша задача : научить вас современным методам оценки и критериям выбора инвестиционных проектов.  Решения о привлечении капитала – это выбор источников финансирования инвестиций (внутренние средства, заемные средства, средства привлеченные путем выпуска новых акций). Наша задача – объяснить мотивы выбора конкретной комбинации  инструментов финансирования в компании и показать, чем определяется оптимальная структура капитала компании (соотношение заемного и собственного капитала).\n\nМы также рассмотрим решения компании о выплатах акционерам, и продемонстрируем как полученные в этом курсе знания позволяют оценивать стоимость компании в целом, с учетом выбранной структуры капитала.\n\nНаконец, мы обсудим роль корпоративного управления (corporate governance) в создании стоимости компании.\n\nЛекторами курса являются профессор Департамента Финансов НИУ ВШЭ Ирина Васильевна Ивашковская и доцент Департамента Финансов Сергей Сергеевич Степанов.\n\nВ разработке заданий курса принимали участие Мария Кокорева, доцент Департамента Финансов НИУ ВШЭ, и Азиза Улугова, преподаватель Департамента Финансов НИУ ВШЭ.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"finance","domainId":"business"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"KtvvfJPSEeWF6gpQJiw6hQ","slug":"osnovy-korporativnykh-finansov","name":"Основы корпоративных финансов (Fundamentals of Corporate Finance)"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"[As described below, this is Part B of a 3-part course.  Participants should complete Part A first -- Part B \"dives right in\" and refers often to material from Part A.]\n\nThis course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A.  Part B assumes successful completion of Part A.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  \n\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"},{"subdomainId":"mobile-and-web-development","domainId":"computer-science"}],"id":"TCmaO25NEeWdfRLY06XVmw","slug":"programming-languages-part-b","name":"Programming Languages, Part B"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) will offer the participants an introduction into the most important classical sociological readings between the 18th and 20th century.

These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly, though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood. Until now! The five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around the world – including successes and failures – through a series of captivating no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too. \n\nWhy? \n\nMore than two generations ago, the venture capital community – VC’s, business angels, incubators, and others – convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns they’ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. But the vast majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding. Are they onto something that most of today’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing it faster? Perhaps not. \n\nHow? \n\nYou’ll be asked to do a series of exercises – out in the real world – to put your growing toolkit to use in your business or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business start and thrive – without venture capital. You’ll join our discussion board of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting the tools to work, just as you are. And to suit today’s fast-paced lifestyles, we’ve broken what you’ll get – short lessons, interviews, thought-provoking questions, even some optional things to read – into bite-sized chunks, so you can log in and grab them whenever and wherever you are.\n\nAnd what else?\n\nIf, after checking out and perhaps completing this course, you find your company in a position where seeking venture capital turns out to be the right thing to do next, John Mullins leads an inspiring and hands-on executive education course at London Business School – this one face-to-face – called Financing the Entrepreneurial Business. There, among a room full of investors and entrepreneurs, you’ll study a series of captivating real-world cases and learn everything an entrepreneur – or an investor, for that matter – needs to know to handle the person who sits across the deal table and take an entrepreneurial business from start-up to exit.

Les thèmes abordés se dérouleront selon une séquence hebdomadaire décrite ci-dessous (section « plan du cours »).\n\nLe virus Ebola qui a été à l’origine de l’épidémie en Afrique de l’Ouest est une souche Zaïre, considérée comme la plus dangereuse. Cependant le spectre des tableaux cliniques rencontrés s’est montré très large : depuis des formes assez bénignes (pour environ 30% des infections), jusqu’à des formes très sévères, presque hors de toute ressources thérapeutiques et fréquemment mortelles en une dizaine de jours en moyenne (environ 30%), en passant par des formes d’une gravité dépendant de l’infrastructure sanitaire responsable de leur prise en charge (c’est-à-dire généralement de bon pronostic en cas de bonne prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique). Près de 60% des contaminations en Afrique avaient comme origine les rites funéraires non sécurisés. Les personnels de santé exposés ont également payé un très lourd tribut à l’épidémie. Enfin les conséquences non sanitaires, d’ordre social, politique et économique de l’épidémie ont été considérables, tant localement, que régionalement ou internationalement. Peu de pays ont connu à ce jour d’importants développements de chaînes de contaminations, en dehors de la Guinée, du Libéria et du Sierra Leone, mais la situation au Mali à la fin novembre 2014 était encore source d’incertitude et d’inquiétude. Les modèles mathématiques, s’ils ont été d’un apport précieux dans l’éclairage des politiques publiques, ils ont aussi participé à une amplification exagérée du problème, notamment lorsqu’ils ont livré des prévisions allant au-delà de plusieurs mois, parfois endossées par de grandes agences sanitaires, car elles risquent de se révéler fausses et décrédibilisantes.\n\nNous tenterons de mieux savoir quels espoirs on peut avoir de disposer d’un vaccin prochainement, et nous essaierons de comprendre pourquoi il aura fallu attendre 38 ans, depuis la découverte du virus Ebola, pour que la communauté internationale se décide à chercher et développer un vaccin contre ce type de virus que l’on savait hautement pathogène et contagieux. La réponse internationale a-t-elle été à la hauteur des enjeux ? L’OMS a-t-elle pu mettre en œuvre le Règlement Sanitaire International dans des conditions satisfaisantes ? Quelle a été la place des ONG dans le règlement du problème ? Toutes ces questions feront l’objet, au cours de ce MOOC, de débats et de points de vue interdisciplinaires, parfois contradictoires. De même, l’importance de la communication, le rôle des médias, la perception du risque par la population et par les décideurs eux-mêmes seront analysés. Une large plage sera réservée aux réponses aux questions des participants adressées aux orateurs par le forum de discussion, afin de réfléchir comment vaincre ensemble Ebola.\n\nPUBLIC CIBLE\nCe MOOC est ouvert et gratuit pour tous les publics. Le public cible est principalement le milieu des soignants francophones et les acteurs (publics et privés) des politiques publiques.\n\nPLAN DU COURS\nModule 1: Présentation générale\nModule 2 : Comprendre la maladie\nles aspects cliniques\nles aspects virologiques\nles aspects immunologiques\nles traitements symptomatiques actuels\nl’épidémiologie de la maladie\n\nModule 3 : Ebola comme symptômes d’un désordre social et politique\nles causes sociales économiques et politiques du problème\nla faiblesse du système\nles aspects culturels\nla pauvreté\n\nModule 4 : Les impacts sur nos vies et nos sociétés\nles impacts sanitaires et économiques sur la société et les institutions\nprésentation de modèles mathématiques et prévisions\n\nModule  5 : Les réponses pour l’Afrique et le monde\nles interventions\nla prise en charge des malades\nles principaux obstacles rencontrés\nla réponse internationale\nla perception du risque\nles développements de médicaments et vaccins\nle volet éthique\nla réponse de l'OMS\nla place de la recherche et des médias\n\nModule 6 : Conclusion\n\n_________________________________\nCe cours est co-produit par l'Université de Genève (UNIGE) et l'Université Numérique Francophone des Sciences du Sport et de la Santé (UNF3S).\nIl est proposé en partenariat avec :\nL'Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF)\nLe Conseil supérieur de la Formation et de la Recherche Stratégique (CSFRS)\nL'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS)\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF)\nSwiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)\nFédération Internationale des Sociétés de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (FISCR)\nCentre Virchow Villermé de santé publique Paris-Berlin\nRadio Télévision Suisse (RTS)\nOffice fédéral de la santé publique (OFSP)\nHôpitaux Universitaires de Genève (HUG)\nInstitut Pasteur\nCampus Biotech\nInfection Control African Network (ICAN)\nThe Graduate Institute Geneva\nMinistère de la Santé et de l'Action Sociale du Sénégal","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"name":"Ebola : Vaincre ensemble !","id":"XGR-fcQ4EeSiTCIAC12odA","slug":"ebola-vaincre-ensemble"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In today’s hotel sector an increasingly complex network of traditional and web based channels have to be managed to insure hotel success.

Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.\n\n The course will explore seven topics:\n\n 1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.\n\n 2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.\n\n 3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.\n\n 4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.\n\n 5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.\n\n 6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.\n\n 7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-strategy"}],"name":"Internet Giants: The Law and Economics of Media Platforms","id":"V9_aHBU7EeWfzgpfp_iBVw","slug":"internetgiants"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course introduces class participants to the political significance and societal consequences of challenges facing U.S. and international policymakers.

The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board, whilst it is preferable to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.  \n\nYou will need internet connectivity to download software, connect to the platform, develop and deploy your IoT solution.\n\nYour Rasberry Pi will need the latest Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with a preconfigured SD card.\n\nIn order to setup the Micro SD card, you will need a computer with either a windows, apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do not have a micro SD port, you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.\n\nTo work on your Raspberry Pi, you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI cable).\nYour Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router, or a USB WiFi dongle if you have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in WiFi\nA USB Keyboard and mouse.\n\nYour Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)\nThere is an IoT Learner kit available from element14 which includes the Raspberry Pi, a pre-flashed SD card, a case and power supply : https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit \n\nWhat prerequisite skills are required ?\nThis is an entry level course, but does assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use both Python and JavaScript programming languages, so some basic skill in these languages is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM Watson IoT Platform is required.\n\nWhat additional resources do I need for this course? \nThe Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Bluemix cloud platform, so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform.\n\nWhen your 30-day trial expires, you can enter a credit card to keep using Bluemix. Bluemix has a set amount of free resources available to users who have registered with their credit card. If you stay within these free resources limits you will not incur any charges. This is a good idea if you are planning to take longer than 30 days to complete the course, or if you have an existing trial account that that is about to expire and you need longer time on the platform to complete the course.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"},{"subdomainId":"machine-learning","domainId":"data-science"}],"id":"iRl53_BWEeW4_wr--Yv6Aw","slug":"developer-iot","name":"A developer's guide to the Internet of Things (IoT)"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"La fijación de precios es una de las decisiones de marketing más importantes, pero menos entendidas. Aprenda y practique conceptos y técnicas, y conozca las últimas reflexiones en materia de evaluación y formulación de estrategias de fijación de precios. Analice el modo en que las empresas tratan de captar valor, además de beneficios, en los ingresos que obtienen. \n\nTras este curso, podrá participar activamente en el proceso de formulación de estrategias de fijación de precios de sus propios productos y servicios, o de los de su empresa. Este curso también pone el foco en la dinámica de la fijación de precios y la reacción de los competidores. Como tal, se utiliza un enfoque muy pragmático y directamente aplicable al día a día de su vida profesional. \n\nEste curso se compone de los cuatro módulos siguientes:\n\n1 - En este módulo, empezaremos por la importancia de la fijación de precios, en especial, para el resultado neto. Teniendo esto en mente, y tras demostrar cómo la fijación de precios es el factor conductor más importante de la rentabilidad, cuando termine este módulo podrá llevar a cabo fijaciones de precios basadas en clientes, en la competencia y en costes. Asimismo, podrá utilizar los conceptos de elasticidad del precio y el precio óptimo al fijar los precios de sus productos y servicios. \n\n2 - Tras finalizar este módulo, podrá aprovechar los cuatro métodos distintos para determinar la disposición a pagar de los clientes. Ya se utilicen opciones como datos de mercado o experimentos (basados en observación) o encuestas a expertos o clientes (basadas en encuestas), podrá utilizar esta información para identificar el precio óptimo.\n\n3 - Lo que vemos en el mundo real es que las empresas no cobran un mismo precio por todos sus productos, sino más bien que fijan precios distintos para productos diferentes con respecto a los diversos segmentos de clientes. Tras estudiar las ventajas de la discriminación de precios (y el significativo potencial en cuanto a ingresos y beneficios que conlleva), podrá entender el tipo de discriminación de precios y la forma de implantarlo en sus productos y servicios.\n\n4 - En este módulo final, hablaremos de la psicología que hay detrás de la fijación de precios. De esta forma, podrá «manipular» a los clientes de modo que perciban un valor superior en los productos y servicios que produce, o les cueste menos pagar el precio de compra de sus productos.  Tendrá a su disposición diversas maneras de maximizar sus ventas, ingresos y rentabilidad. También realizaremos un par de experimentos con clientes voluntarios para ver cómo el precio afecta en las percepciones, y cómo puede beneficiarse de ello.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"marketing"}],"id":"eQ2a1KTsEeWkKArXiJndEw","slug":"estrategia-precios","name":"Estrategia de precios"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is designed for high school students preparing to take the AP* Physics 1 Exam. * AP Physics 1 is a registered trademark of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, this product.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"physics-and-astronomy"}],"id":"z-Ezh6UFEeWGbRLK1bnBqw","slug":"ap-physics-1","name":"Preparing for the AP Physics 1 Exam"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"HI-FIVE (Health Informatics For Innovation, Value & Enrichment) Training is an approximately 10-hour online course designed by Columbia University in 2016, with sponsorship from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).

Entrepreneurs generally start with a mission, a new idea that they want to bring to the world. If the idea is original, it is probably not expected by the market, which has to be educated. This is a very costly experience. Entrepreneurs need to gather capital at the start of the journey. They need to articulate clear plans, define objectives and resources and raise money accordingly. They also need to manage cash for two reasons: i) because the better it is managed, the less you need to raise with outsiders; ii) because generation of cash flow is the pillar of the valuation of the company. And we should add that the practical reason why a company gets bankrupted is because it runs out of cash..\nThe course is based on this belief. We look at the myth of the balance sheet and explain the dynamics of cash flows and the way they should be managed. We also investigate the basics of venture capital and provide a practical roadmap to entrepreneurs.\n\nMany courses are dedicated to the same topic. Our originality is that we operate in the advisory board of the private equity firm, Xerys and are board members of their venture companies.

For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we’ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing.\n\nThis course, entitled ‘Philosophy and Religion’, is the second of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series, and in this course we will ask important questions about the age-old debate between science and religion, such as:\n \n•  What kind of conflicts are there between religion and science?\n•  Does current cognitive science of religion effectively explain away God?\n•  If there is a God who has made us so that we can know him, why do some people not believe?\n•  Is belief in science also a kind of fundamentalism?\n•  What makes us good at getting, giving, or sharing, knowledge?

To address these public health crises, we urgently need to explore innovative strategies for promoting healthful eating. There is strong evidence that global increases in the consumption of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation of food in the home, have contributed to high rates of preventable, chronic disease. In this course, learners will be given the information and practical skills they need to begin optimizing the way they eat. This course will shift the focus away from reductionist discussions about nutrients and move, instead, towards practical discussions about real food and the environment in which we consume it. By the end of this course, learners should have the tools they need to distinguish between foods that will support their health and those that threaten it. In addition, we will present a compelling rationale for a return to simple home cooking, an integral part of our efforts to live longer, healthier lives.\n\nView the trailer for the course here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7x1aaZ03xU","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"nutrition","domainId":"life-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"id":"xMqZG1wyEeWd6BJKWlaBIw","slug":"food-and-health","name":"Stanford Introduction to Food and Health"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"互联网正在改变人们生活的方方面面，现在终于开始冲击工业文明的顽固堡垒——学校教育、考试模式了!一场重要的攻坚战，是在学校教育的基石——课程领域展开的，突破口是由MOOCs（大规模开放在线课程）打开的。教育改变命运，学习开创未来，而教育的未来显然与MOOCs密切相关……要想了解什么是MOOCs?它将给大学乃至整个学校教育带来什么样的变化?如何以此为契机创新学习方式和考试模式?……就赶快加盟我们的《网络课程与学习评价》探索之旅吧! 在这里，你一定能找到志同道合的学习伙伴，找到提升创造性学习能力的钥匙，找到超越自我，成为终身学习者的内在动力……让我们一起\"求师问道\"，共同开创东西方教育对话交融，现实与网络阴阳互补，教师与学生协同创新的\"太极学堂”！\n\nThe Internet is changing every aspect of our lives, and it has finally started to work on an obstinate fortress of industrial civilization: school education and evaluation!

Here we invite you to develop analytical skills and deep understanding about a complex, controversial policy problem – one with no simple, easy answers. About half a billion people on our planet still lack access to improved water supplies and about two billion do not have improved sanitation services, leading to an unknown but very large number of avoidable deaths each year from water-related diseases. Millions of dollars are spent on avoidable health care expenditures, and people – mostly women – spend many billions of hours carrying water from sources outside the home. Reducing these costs is a major global challenge for us all in the 21st century. Join us to explore the challenging and complex political, economic, social, and technical dimensions of the policy interventions that donors, national governments and water utilities use to address this challenge. This second MOOC consists of the following seven sessions:\n\n•\tSession 1: Introduction and how our ‘ancient instincts’ affect water policy interventions.\n•\tSession 2: Planning better policy interventions: Roles, features and examples of planning protocols.\n•\tSession 3: Water pricing, tariff design and subsidies.\n•\tSession 4: Providing information to households and communities to improve water and sanitation conditions.\n•\tSession 5: Changing the institutions that deliver water and sanitation services: Privatization in developing countries.\n•\tSession 6: Changing institutions: Lessons from the UK water privatization story.\n•\tSession 7: Changing institutions: Improving regulation of the water and sanitation sector.\n\nYour instructors for this course have worked in and studied this sector for many years. Professor Dale Whittington has worked on water and sanitation policy and planning issues for over 40 years in more than two dozen low and middle-income countries. Dr Duncan Thomas has worked in the UK and European water sectors for 15 years, focusing on overcoming barriers to technological, organizational, regulatory and policy innovations. \n\nPlease watch this introductory video outlining the course: https://youtu.be/KkBmo3EKkkI","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"eGjoytoJEeWyqBL0ju_dbQ","slug":"water-part-2","name":"Water Supply and Sanitation Policy in Developing Countries Part 2: Developing Effective Interventions"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Aprenderás  las bases y los procedimientos precisos paso a paso para que puedas llevar a cabo la autoconstrucción de una vivienda básica, segura y económica para ti y tu familia; también te será de gran utilidad si estás buscando aprender a reparar,  mejorar la estructura de tu vivienda e incluso si buscas autoemplearte.\n¡Atrévete a mejorar tus habilidades en un tema que es siempre útil y necesario!","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"mechanical-engineering","domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering"},{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"}],"id":"CVrclTu_EeW0tw4knrMo3Q","slug":"como-autoconstruir-tu-vivienda","name":"Cómo autoconstruir tu vivienda"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Welcome!\nDo you wish to know how to analyze and solve business and economic questions with data analysis tools?

Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   \n\nFurthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. \n\nAt the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. \n\nThe Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities’ exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle – from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.\n\nIn line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? \n\nCourse Objectives:\nAt the end of this course, learners should be able to:\n\n•\tRecognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities\n•\tUnderstand the drivers of urban risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change \n•\tDistinguish the typologies, approaches, and tensions of climate change adaptation \n•\tExplain the different approaches and steps in climate change planning \n•\tExamine the decision support and assessment tools for climate change\n•\tDevelop a climate change plan based on participants’ city contexts","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"ng-wV6BDEea7DQoksxKcjg","slug":"planning-climate-change-african-cities","name":"Planning for Climate Change in African Cities"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Este curso esta diseñado para emprendedores tecnológicos que tengan la ambición de ser globales.

Широкий спектр сегодняшних значений оформлялся в течение длительного времени, пройдя путь от «культуры» в значении возделывании земли у античных авторов до сегодняшнего многозначного термина. Предлагаемый курс «Философия культуры» нацелен на передачу подробной и структурированной хронологии философских учений о культуре, освоение базового концептуального аппарата и рассмотрение механизмов взаимодействия человека и культуры / раскрытие специфики философии культуры как объяснительной модели. Содержание лекций выстраивается вокруг сюжетов о морфологии различных типов культур от античности до современности. Особое внимание уделяется западноевропейской культуре Нового времени.\n\n\nВ результате освоения материалов курса «Философия культуры» студент будет знать:\n•\tосновные исторические типы философских теорий культуры, их своеобразие, логику их построения;\n•\tосновные проблемы и парадоксы, связанные с опытом построения теорий культуры.\n\nИ уметь:\n•\tвыявлять в разнородном эмпирическом материале культур закономерности их развития, \n•\tвидеть связи ряда тенденций современной культуры с исторической традицией.\n\nКурс «Философия культуры» носит вводный характер рассчитан на широкий круг слушателей, вне зависимости от наличия у них профильного гуманитарного образования, интересующихся культурой как предметом научного знания. \n\nAbout this course:\nThe notion of “culture” may imply various behavioral norms, areas of production or management, similar habits and traditions within social groups. The wide spectrum of multiple meanings has been developing over a long period of time, starting with land cultivation as the first meaning of culture (according to antique authors) and resulting in a modern multivocal notion of culture. The “Philosophy of Culture” course is focused on delivering the detailed and structured chronology of philosophical teachings about culture, mastering the basic conceptual apparatus, and familiarization with the mechanisms of interactions between culture and humanity, revealing philosophy of culture features as an explanatory model. The content of lectures is built around subjects that concern the morphology of different types of cultures from the antique times to modernity with the emphasis on the Western-Europe culture of the Modern Age.\n\nUpon the completion of the “Philosophy of Culture” course the student will know:\n•\tThe main historical types of the philosophical theories of culture, their specifics, the logic of their construction\n•\tThe major problems and paradoxes concerning the experience of constructing theories of the philosophy of culture\n\nAlso he or she will be able to:\n•\tDiscover the patterns of cultural development within the heterogeneous empiric environment. \n•\tTo see the connections between the series of modern cultural trends and the historical tradition\n\nWho this course is for:\nThis introductory course might be interesting for the Humanity students, as well as for anyone who is starting to study theory and history of culture. The “Philosophy of Culture” is designed for the wide audience interested in culture as a subject of scientific knowledge and does not require a completed major in the Humanities.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"}],"id":"lznOiR08EeagBBLYvz0q6w","slug":"filosofiya-kultury","name":"Философия культуры (Philosophy of Culture)"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Данный курс поможет обучающимся преодолеть трудности, вызванные недостаточным знанием математики и использовать свои знания для решения физических задач.

We use Excel to do our calculations, and all math formulas are given as Excel Spreadsheets, but we do not attempt to cover Excel Macros, Visual Basic, Pivot Tables, or other intermediate-to-advanced Excel functionality.\n\nThis course will prepare you to design and implement realistic predictive models based on data. In the Final Project (module 6) you will assume the role of a business data analyst for a bank, and develop two different predictive models to determine which applicants for credit cards should be accepted and which rejected. Your first model will focus on minimizing default risk, and your second on maximizing bank profits. The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.\n\nThe second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information, and confidence intervals for linear regression.\n\nAll the data you need is provided within the course, all assignments are designed to be done in MS Excel, and you will learn enough Excel to complete all assignments. The course will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions, and you’ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality you might need in the future (module 1).\n\nThe course does not cover Visual Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments. All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions. You will emerge with substantial vocabulary and practical knowledge of how to apply business data analysis methods based on binary classification (module 2), information theory and entropy measures (module 3), and linear regression (module 4 and 5), all using no software tools more complex than Excel.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"data-analysis","domainId":"data-science"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"id":"SpO4HBnoEeWjrA6seF25aw","slug":"analytics-excel","name":"Mastering Data Analysis in Excel"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Данный учебный курс посвящен истории Санкт-Петербурга с момента его основания в 1703 году до отъезда большевистского правительства в Москву в 1918 году.

For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.\n\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist.

В результате взаимодействия людей и фирм складываются рынки, на которых определяется цена – важнейший канал передачи информации.\n\nЧтобы информации было больше, существуют рынки, на которых продаются и покупаются товары и услуги. Потребитель никогда не купит нужный ему товар, если не узнает, где и как его можно купить. Производитель не станет его изготавливать, если не будет уверен, что найдется покупатель, который его приобретет. Каждый человек и каждая фирма обладает какими-то сведениями – прежде всего о себе самом, о своих вкусах, интересах, потребностях и возможностях. Однако информации у всех становится во много раз больше, когда субъекты начинают взаимодействовать – производят и потребляют, продают, покупают и меняются. Поведение людей и фирм на рынках – основной предмет изучения в курсе микроэкономики.\n\nThe introductory course in Microeconomics describes the basic instruments of economic analysis, which allow us to study the most important patterns in behavior of people and firms.

The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as \"lifeline infrastructure\". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated \"lifeline\" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.

Nevertheless, they often are poorly understood by many, even including many who are engaged in the business of producing milk. The overall course goal is to introduce fundamental concepts that form the basis for understanding the biology of lactation, the biology of the mammary gland, and the products of that important physiological process.\n\nAs a learner in this course, you will be provided with a series of easily understood presentations that collectively will help you build a foundation for greater understanding of lactation. You will be able to engage with other learners so that you can extend your learning beyond the video presentations. Ultimately, you will be able to construct your own mental model for understanding the wide range of topics that relate to the biology of lactation. Upon completion of the course, you will be prepared to expand your knowledge and understanding of lactation from other sources and experiences as you pursue your individual interests.\n\nBefore you start the course, I suggest that you identify a question or several questions about lactation that you already have on your mind. This could be from your own experiences, something you read about or saw, or something you have wondered about. Write down your question(s) and use that to help you decide how to engage with the content of this course. You might engage with the modules in the order they are presented, or start with a module that is of particular interest to you, or pick and choose modules in any order.

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.\n\nData science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\n1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\n2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\n3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.\n\nAfter taking this course you should:\n- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),\n- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,\n- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,\n- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),\n- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,\n- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,\n- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and\n- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"data-analysis","domainId":"data-science"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"id":"SN5tm_tBEeScRyIAC3-PxA","slug":"process-mining","name":"Process Mining: Data science in Action"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The course deals with the analysis of the private equity and venture capital business. \nOver the course, students will be provided with a deep understanding of the mechanism underpinning the creation and/or development of a firm and the financial support it can get from the financial system through venture capital investment.\n\nThe course tries to discover how special financial intermediaries (called private equity investors) finance through equity companies belonging to different stages of their life-cycle, starting from the very beginning (startup and early stage) to a more mature phase (i.e. expansion, mature age, etc.) or also staying into crises and decline. \n\nPrivate equity (named venture capital when the company is in the first phases of its life cycle) deals with very different activities, such as scouting, advisory, deal-making, valuation, and financing as financial intermediaries see it.

This scheme became normative in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (Hīnayāna), (ii) the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajrayāna), also referred to as “esoteric Buddhism” or “Buddhist tantra”. To this, we will add a fourth Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”. We follow an indigenous Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course’s discussion of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.\n\nThe five modules of the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives, treat the first five of these twelve types.

Our world is submitted to regular changes as organizations evolve, come and go. Understanding your memberships and attachments to organizations will help you act on your world. You'll learn how to evaluate the influence of organizations around you and how to transform your relationships to reach a stronger coherence.\n\nDo you feel sometime that the world around you is disorganized? Can you make sense of all the information at your reach and have an impact on this situation? Have you ever thought that this conundrum may be due to all the organizations that emerge, strive or wane, and disappear every day? \n\nOrganizations are ubiquitous, from clubs and associations to firms and public agencies. Organizations confer meaning to all of us, and our attachment and membership to organizations have a profound effect on all areas of our lives. But in our increasingly turbulent world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy, steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.\n\nThis course develops an integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed ‘orgology’. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing, organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society, thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.  \n\nIn turn, individuals, you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of understanding organizations’ relationships with society results in reconsidering management and the role of individuals in building their future.\n\nThere is no prerequisite to this course, you are all welcome ! Students and people interested in the fields of management, sociology, strategy, economics leadership etc… will benefit a lot from this course.\n\nFor the session of this course starting on January 11th, Professor Rodolphe Durand will actively be participating and interacting with learners.

Are these modes incompatible? Put another way: is the intellectually responsible thing to do to ‘pick sides’ and identify with one of these approaches at the exclusion of others? Or, are they complementary or mutually supportive? As is typical of questions of such magnitude, the devil is in the details. For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we’ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing.\n\nThis course, entitled ‘Science and Philosophy’, will serve as the first of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series, and in this first course we will ask important questions about the nature of scientific knowledge, its limits and implications for the disciplines of philosophy and religion, as well as for their intersection. \n\nWe begin by asking whether scientific claims aspire to absolute truth. For instance, are there any scientific claims that are absolutely true, or are they all true relative to the system of thought that generated them? If we accept the latter, does this also hold true of any claims we might make, including within the domains of philosophy and religion? In this Science and Philosophy course we will also be exploring in some detail current and exciting questions about the relationship between physics and faith, science and pseudoscience, creationism and evolutionary biology. \n\nThe second and third courses in the Philosophy, Science and Religion series—‘Philosophy and Religion’ and ‘Religion and Science’—will be launched later in 2017.

Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.\n\nThis course is intended for students interested in tackling all facets of optimization applications. You will learn an entirely new way to think about solving these challenging problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest. This will allow you to unlock the power of industrial solving technologies, which have been perfected over decades by hundreds of PhD researchers.  With access to this advanced technology, problems that are considered inconceivable to solve before will suddenly become easy.\n\nWatch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc3cBvtrem0&t=8s","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"},{"domainId":"math-and-logic","subdomainId":"math-and-logic"}],"id":"FHRfjx4bEea5XBKU2ED_yw","slug":"basic-modeling","name":"Basic Modeling for Discrete Optimization"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Many of us derive inspiration from watching natural history documentaries and their astounding catalogue of wild animal behaviours.  In this course, we will explore how scientists study animal behaviour, and in particular how behaviour is shaped by the evolutionary forces of natural and sexual selection. Topics include resource acquisition; avoiding enemies; mate choice and sexual conflict; cues, signals and communication; parental care and social behaviour; and the role of genes, environments and learning in regulating behavioural diversity.  We draw on examples from across the animal kingdom to illustrate the complex mechanisms underlying adaptations, and complement these with natural history videos that highlight key concepts.

But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.\n\nIn this course, you will explore some of Live’s most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not own Ableton Live 9, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial.

We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. \n\nThe fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.\n\nSo why use this approach? \n\nOne reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. \n\nA second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  \n\nA third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\nRecommended Background: \nThe class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nReadings will be assigned from the on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via Rice’s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.  A particularly good free on-line resource is Dickerson, Gray, and Haight, \"Chemical Principles, 3rd Edition\".

In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high. \n \nSince then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\n\nAfter we’ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology.

It could be not only something tangible like the pair of jeans you've ordered using the app but also a piece of work like waking you up in the morning. It could be a feeling, for instance, a feeling of enjoyment obtained from watching a video clip or a feeling of closeness flashed out after receiving an old photo from a loving person via some instant messenger. That \"something\" is actually the reason why you use the app, it is the heart of the product, and in this course we will not talk about it. Surprised? You shouldn’t be. There are always two sides of a coin. There should be a person who makes that \"something\" accessible. It is astonishingly important because the use of the product loses its meaning if users can’t get what they want.\n\nThe main objective of the course is to teach you to shape mobile products and services for people’s use. To do that, you’ll need to learn:\n- Interaction design activities and their place in the whole product design process\n- User research methods with a focus on the qualitative ones\n- Usability inspection and empirical usability evaluation methods\n- The process of design creation and best practices from interaction design, information architecture and visual design fields of study with a focus on the former\nInterfaces of handheld devices and tablets are in the spotlight. However, the processes and techniques covered by the course can be successfully applied to design interactions with mobile web apps and wearables. It should be noted that this course does not cover topics such as design management and mobile development, and it will as well not teach you how to use wireframing and prototyping tools.\n\nWhat makes the course unique is a focus on the way of thinking during a design process, the representation of a designer’s decisions in the form of design questions that make the continuous reflection on the design process possible and leads to the growth of the number of proposed design alternatives. The second unique thing about this course is a focus on the explanation of the concept of usability problems, and the processes of discovering and analysing them.\n\nUpon completion of the course, you will be able to:\n- Improve designs by eliminating different kinds of interaction problems\n- Design huge chunks of user interfaces in the case of adding a new feature to a product\n- Redesign a complete app by a given set of functions (e.g., extending an existing product to a new platform)\n\nThe practical part of the course will require you to discover and eliminate interaction problems of a chosen mobile app. You will go through running guerrilla usability study, analysing gathered data, and making evidence-based design changes, which will enable you to create your first case study.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"design-and-product","domainId":"computer-science"}],"id":"Ycu2Tay_EeaVdxKCaraLyA","slug":"mobile-interaction-design","name":"Mobile Interaction Design: How to Design Usable Mobile Products and Services"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"<<< ATTENTION >>> Learners interested in Google Cloud Platform: A brand-new Specialization with cloud-infrastructure content by Google Cloud is now available!

These perturbations are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology. The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is commissioned to organize, analyze, visualize and integrate this data with other publicly available relevant resources.

How does it differ from science, religion, and other modes of human discourse?  This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"philosophy","domainId":"arts-and-humanities"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"gZ6cbKKkEeW1Bw7HN8tFsw","slug":"aristotle","name":"Ancient Philosophy: Aristotle and His Successors"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Al finalizar el curso: \n\n•\tExplicarás la aplicación de la norma ISO 9000 y los sistemas de gestión de calidad, su implementación y los beneficios para la compañía y la sociedad.\n•\tDescribirás herramientas prácticas que mejoren la competitividad y eleven la eficiencia de las operaciones de la empresa o idea de negocio teniendo en cuenta las mejores prácticas ambientales.\n\nEn este curso conoceremos la importancia que tiene implementar estándares de calidad y procesos productivos eficientes, para el desarrollo y continuidad de nuestra empresa o idea de negocio y así mantener su máxima capacidad productiva y seguir ofertando productos con los más altos estándares de calidad, para mantenernos siempre en la preferencia del público.\n\nEs importante resaltar también términos como capacidad, ubicación y distribución operativa con la que cuenta nuestra empresa o idea de negocio, porque al identificarlas podemos mejorar la productividad sin hacer a un lado la calidad, a la vez que identificamos las deficiencias la producción para nuestra empresa o idea de negocio.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-strategy"}],"id":"xYLZebWrEeWEoAqTi6kTYw","slug":"gestion-de-productividad","name":"Introducción a la Calidad"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Galileo dijo: \"El Universo está escrito en lenguaje matemático y los caracteres son triángulos, círculos y otras figuras geométricas, sin las que es humanamente imposible entender una sola palabra\".\n    Para entender el Universo, es necesario plantear leyes que expliquen su comportamiento, como pueden ser las leyes de la gravedad, la propagación del calor, el electromagnetismo, la reproducción celular, el crecimiento poblacional, la propagación de las enfermedades, la variación de los precios de las acciones en la bolsa de valores, el comportamiento de las masas ante un conflicto, etcétera.\n    Todas estas leyes se plantean utilizando ecuaciones, algunas muy sencillas, otras no tanto.

En el mundo contemporáneo, el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles, Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como \"posmetrópolis\", \"ciudades globales\" y \"ciudades-regiones globales\". La clase estudiará debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué? ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes, sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación, y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación? ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? \nPor el momento, y considerando las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos, culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción, existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas, calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias, representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética; los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno, movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio, entre otros.\nLos asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas, gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos, creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.  \n\nTodos los vídeos realizados por Sciences Po para este MOOC están a cargo de Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\n\nPerfil recomendado\n\nEl curso está diseñado para estudiantes de pregrado, pero también puede ser de interés para estudiantes de posgrado y profesionales en el sector de asuntos urbanos.\n\n\nPrograma del curso :\n\nSemana 1: Introducción, definición, asuntos urbanos y el uso de modelos\nSemana 2: Ciudades europeas y el modelo weberiano de integración\nSemana 3: Ciudades coloniales y poscoloniales\nSemana 4: Ciudades industriales (y ciudades socialistas) y modelos marxistas\nSemana 5: Las metrópolis norteamericanas y la Escuela de Chicago \nSemana 6: Posmetrópolis, fragmentos y diferencias\nSemana 7: Ciudades globales y megaciudades\nSemana 8: Ciudades inteligentes y la sociología de la ciencia y la tecnología","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"lswH0jTZEea1ggpF7DR5sw","slug":"desarrollo-urbano","name":"Cities are back in town : sociología urbana para un mundo globalizado"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course is the first in a series on starting a business.

Today, more than 3.9 billion people, making up more than 54% of the global population, live in cities. Urbanization is expected to continue in the coming years, raising the urban population to 6.0 billion by 2045. This dramatic increase in urban populations will inevitably increase the demand for energy, mobility (transportation), water, and other urban services in every city around the world. Without functional governance and management structures that ensure efficient, resilient and sustainable performance in cities, the current urbanization growth might become a catastrophic risk threatening the quality of life of the humanity.\n\nSustainable development in 21st century can only be realized by introducing innovations in both management and operations of urban infrastructures systems. Developing management practices that effectively integrates the processes of urban planning with urban infrastructures planning and management is a challenging goal that many cities are struggling with  nowadays, but is a must for transforming cities to sustainable and resilient engines of growth in both developing and developed economies. \nThis course will provide you with the basic principles of urban infrastructure management that are fundamental for building prosperous cities that are sustainable, resilient and efficient. \n\nIn order to obtain a certificate for this course, the participants have to pass four graded quizzes and complete four mandatory assignments, plus a final exam. In addition to the graded assignments students have the option to write a 7-10 page peer-reviewed case study about management of energy OR transportation system in their city (on your own choice). \nThe best case studies will be also evaluated by our jury at IGLUS and the authors of the 3 best case studies will win a full tuition fee waiver scholarship to enroll in the IGLUS professional training program in Spring 2017. \n\nYou can also pre-enroll in our upcoming MOOC on Smart Cities now.

Dans le même temps, de nouvelles formes de mobilités se sont développées, comme la multirésidentialité, la pendularité de longue distance, le tourisme urbain et l’excursionnisme. Ces changements ont été concommittants de transformations urbaines comme l’étalement urbain ou la fragmentation.\n\nDans ce contexte, la mobilité est un enjeu pour l’ingénierie des transports urbains et le développement territorial, en particulier urbain: sa régulation nécessite une appréhension nouvelle de la demande de transport.\n\nLe cours montre ainsi aux étudiants les interrelations entre la ville et la mobilité, l’espace urbain et les flux de déplacements, tout en leur offrant une vision renouvelée du transport et de son impact sur le territoire et les modes de vie.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"17a-elI1EeWxCwowHhzTpQ","slug":"mobiurba","name":"Mobilité et urbanisme"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"While the human genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t just the sequence of your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  \n\nEpigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided. There are no additional required texts for this course. For those interested, additional information can be obtained in the following textbook.\n\nEpigenetics. Allis, Jenuwein, Reinberg and Caparros.

The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.\n\nToday, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?\n\nThis course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead “has given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.” This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth?

Serving as windows unto a lost world of kings, ladies, faith, war, and culture, they communicate complex visual and textual narratives of Europe’s collective cultural heritage and patrimony. In this fashion, illuminated manuscripts are dynamic messages from our communal past that are still relevant today in fields like graphic design and typography.\n\nIn this seven-week course, students will explore the material creation, content, and historical context of illuminated medieval European manuscripts. Students will acquire an introductory knowledge of their distinguishing characteristics, their cataloguing and periodization (when they were created), the methods utilized to produce them, and their historical context and value.\n\nStudent achievement will be assessed using not only traditional multiple-choice quizzes, but more importantly will be evaluated based on individual student projects. In their final projects students will either (1) produce a board of commented images about medieval manuscripts or (2) prepare a physical manuscript using medieval methods. The best of these peer-evaluated projects will be posted on the Deciphering Secrets website, which is our collective citizen scholarship web presence that encourages and supports our global citizen scholars appreciation and contributions to transcription of medieval manuscripts.\n\nFinally, we wish to highlight that this course is an exciting international collaboration between the University of Colorado (USA) and Universidad Complutense Madrid (Spain).","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"id":"QuKyoTrbEeWJaxK5AT4frw","slug":"medieval-europe","name":"Deciphering Secrets: The Illuminated Manuscripts of Medieval Europe"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This is the first course in the Learn English: Intermediate Grammar specialization.

Rarely will they have all the information necessary to predict what consumers will do with complete certainty. By incorporating uncertainty into the decisions that they make, they can anticipate a wide range of possible outcomes and recognize the extent of uncertainty on the decisions that they make. In Incorporating Uncertainty into Marketing Decisions, learners will become familiar with different methods to recognize sources of uncertainty that may affect the marketing decisions they ultimately make. We eschew specialized software and provide learners with the foundational knowledge they need to develop sophisticated marketing models in a basic spreadsheet environment. Topics include the development and application of Monte Carlo simulations, and the use of probability distributions to characterize uncertainty.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"marketing"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"id":"I4RbHTTPEeaU3A4B1dNclw","slug":"uncertainty-marketing-decisions","name":"Managing Uncertainty in Marketing Analytics"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL\n\nPara todas aquellas personas que han querido saber cómo se creaba un videojuego, en este curso vamos a explicar cómo crear un pequeño motor, uno de los elementos nucleares de cualquier videojuego.

These representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more. They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems. \n\nThis course is the first in a sequence of three. It describes the two basic PGM representations: Bayesian Networks, which rely on a directed graph; and Markov networks, which use an undirected graph. The course discusses both the theoretical properties of these representations as well as their use in practice. The (highly recommended) honors track contains several hands-on assignments on how to represent some real-world problems.

In this course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your abstract thinking skills.   \n\nAfter finishing this course, you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption, and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing, and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like throughput, latency and buffering.\n\nDisclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.\n\nThis course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven), TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente).

Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.\n***********************************************************************************************************\n                                                                           \nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n \n• Week 1: Introduction \nWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology! This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic at hand: myth! How can we begin to define \"myth\"? How does myth work? What have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth? This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry.\nReadings: No texts this week, but it would be a good idea to get started on next week's reading to get ahead of the game. \nVideo Lectures: 1.1-1.7 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 2: Becoming a Hero \nIn week 2, we begin our intensive study of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as he begins to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys homeward after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism, relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values of hospitality and resourcefulness.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8 \nVideo Lectures: 2.1-2.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 3: Adventures Out and Back \nThis week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations of Odysseus, \"man of twists and turns,\" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys abroad and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion of the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also follow Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives. Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from all of ancient myth.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16 \nVideo Lectures: 3.1-3.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 4: Identity and Signs \nAs he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on Ithaca and with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources to regain his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants, his dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against those who have usurped his place.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24 \nVideo Lectures: 4.1-4.8 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 5: Gods and Humans \nWe will take a close look at the most authoritative story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony. Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony, or \"birth of the gods,\" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.\nReadings: Hesiod, Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)* \nVideo Lectures: 5.1-5.9 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 6: Ritual and Religion \nThis week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they like us humans to perform.\nReadings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course) \nVideo Lectures: 6.1-6.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 7: Justice \nWhat counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one? Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think. This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to him. This family's cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode, carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.\nReadings: Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides \nVideo Lectures: 7.1-7.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 8: Unstable Selves\nThis week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae. Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae, the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage. Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.\nReadings: Sophocles, Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae \nVideo Lectures: 8.1-8.9\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade \nMoving ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making in action.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5 \nVideo Lectures: 9.1-9.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 10: Roman Myth and Ovid's Metamorphoses \nOur consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound, witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through the lens of the Romans and others who \"remythologize,\" we wrap up the course with a retrospective look at myth.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid, Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13. \nVideo Lectures: 10.1-10.9.\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n***********************************************************************************************************\nREADINGS\nThere are no required texts for the course, however, Professor Struck will make reference to the following texts in the lecture:\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 1, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, trans.

Music accompanies us when we are traveling, doing sports, shopping, working or relaxing. This omnipresence of music raises several questions: how does music affect our lives? What is the relation between the society we live in and the role, function, and position of music within that society? How is music influenced by and does music influence social, political, economic, technological, and multiple other developments? \n\nDo these questions trigger you?

Con ello quería señalar algo que es evidente: que las personas  no somos máquinas y, por ello, no somos programables. Sin embargo, sí que tenemos unas necesidades que satisfacer, y unas características comunes. Y conocerlas - qué motiva a las personas en el ámbito laboral, qué necesidades buscan satisfacer, y por qué - ayuda a entender mejor el comportamiento en las organizaciones. Por ejemplo, nos sirve para dar respuesta a las siguientes cuestiones: ¿cómo es posible que aún ganando mucho dinero una persona no esté motivada para trabajar? O lo contrario, ¿cómo es posible que a pesar de ganar muy poco dinero una persona esté dispuesta a trabajar con ahínco? ¿Qué comportamientos y cualidades debe mostrar un buen líder? ¿Es factible desarrollar dichas capacidades? ¿Por qué hay equipos que tienen un alto rendimiento mientras otros no? Y a la vez, ¿cómo medir el rendimiento de un equipo?  ¿Qué es la cultura de la organización y qué importancia tiene?\n\nDurante estas cuatro semanas de curso sobre gestión de personas y equipos, abordaremos distintos enfoques y marcos teóricos que nos permitan dar respuesta a todas estas preguntas.

Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. \n\nA massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they've hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging. \n\nDuring this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined. \n\nIn addition to learning about Cleveland's attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.\n\nOne of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we've learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions. \n\nMost MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures, but this course will be different.

But how do we develop this virtue? And why do so many people still end up so arrogant? Do our own biases hold us back from becoming as intellectually humble as we could be—and are there some biases that actually make us more likely to be humble? Which cognitive dispositions and personality traits give people an edge at being more intellectually humble - and are they stable from birth, learned habits, or something in between? And what can contemporary research on the emotions tell us about encouraging intellectual humility in ourselves and others?\n\nExperts in psychology, philosophy and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether it’s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.\n \nIn this course, we will examine the following major questions about the science of intellectual humility:\n• How do we become intellectually humble?\n• What can human cognition tell us about intellectual humility?\n• How does arrogance develop, and how can we become more open-minded?\n• How do emotions affect our ability to be intellectually humble? \n \nAll lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life. \n\nThis course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility.

It does not aspire to cover theories of taxation, public expenditures, regulation etc. at length and in-depth. Rather, our ambition is to give a bird's-eye view of central themes of public economics and related disciplines, and teach concepts, logic, and ideas, rather than methods of analysis, which would require an entirely different course format.\n\nOur choice of topics covered by the course reflects a trade-off between salience and centrality, on the one hand, and suitability for a brief online introductory course, on the other. The course content is neither comprehensive (which would be a \"mission impossible\" for virtually any public economics course\"), nor representative of other such courses. With these limitations and caveats in mind, we encourage our students to continue their public economics studies in a more regular fashion, and see our role inter alia in motivating interest in such \"continued education\".\n\nThe central theme of the course is the role of government as a mechanism of resource allocation which complements and augments markets. Governments are viewed as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two imperfect alternatives. We deal with government's limitations, with particular emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative capacity, and imperfect accountability to society. Otherwise the course's man themes are economics of taxation, regulation, politics of public economics, incentives in government, and government vis-à-vis (civil) society.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"finance","domainId":"business"}],"id":"0GYQX5MEEeWBAQoVMoNgNQ","slug":"public-economics","name":"Public Economics"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"The ability to understand and apply Business Statistics is becoming increasingly important in the industry. A good understanding of Business Statistics is a requirement to make correct and relevant interpretations of data.

We begin with the notion of descriptive statistics, which is summarizing data using a few numbers. Different categories of descriptive measures are introduced and discussed along with the Excel functions to calculate them. The notion of probability or uncertainty is introduced along with the concept of a sample and population data using relevant business examples. This leads us to various statistical distributions along with their Excel functions which are then used to model or approximate business processes. You get to apply these descriptive measures of data and various statistical distributions using easy-to-follow Excel based examples which are demonstrated throughout the course.\n\nTo successfully complete course assignments, students must have access to Microsoft Excel. \n________________________________________\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Basic Data Descriptors\nIn this module you will get to understand, calculate and interpret various descriptive or summary measures of data.

This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain. \n\nFor the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it! \n\nIn this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-strategy"}],"name":"Supply Chain Management: A Learning Perspective ","id":"-1YwAnTLEeSjmyIAC0aXFg","slug":"supply-chain-management"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Typically, clients and managers don't want to pay for design (or strategy) -- they want ‘results’!

You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. \n\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen.

They can be found nearly everywhere in today’s society: universities, start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations, restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many examples of organizations.\n\nOrganizations are as varied and complex as they are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!); they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants and the organization’s survival.\n\nIn this course, we will use organizational theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization’s structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production, and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized. Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best redirect the organization in desired directions.\n\nIn sum, the course has three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of “seeing” and managing organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools and ways to negotiate novel situations.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"T4_v6hfTEeaUCRJWL-pjpQ","slug":"organizational-analysis","name":"Organizational Analysis "},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Bem vindo ao segundo curso de desenvolvimento de aplicativos para iPhone e iPad.\nQuer fazer um aplicativo que navegue por múltiplas telas?

To gain the most relevant knowledge from these courses, learners should have taken a basic accounting course prior to this Specialization (which can be done through Coursera courses, such as any accounting course from the Fundamentals of Accounting Specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/accounting-fundamentals). This Specialization focuses on accounting concepts, principles and theory with an emphasis on problems that arise in applying these concepts for external reporting purposes.  Specific emphasis is placed on measurement of assets, liabilities, equities and income, as well as disclosure of additional information that may assist users understand the financial reports.  \n\nIn this course, we will begin our review of key asset categories underlying the Balance Sheet concepts that were introduced in the previous course.  We will begin our trek down the Balance Sheet by reviewing cash and receivables, which are normally the two assets listed first. We will continue our trek down the Balance Sheet by looking at inventory and long-Lived Assets, which are normally two of the largest asset values. We will review the measurement and reporting issues involving Inventories and the corresponding cost of goods sold expense in the Income Statement. In the latter half of this course we will conclude our review of key asset categories by looking at both tangible and intangible long-lived assets that are so vital to the production of goods and services. This will entail discussion of both acquisition and disposition of property, plant and equipment as well as cost allocation. Next, we will discuss possible impairment of these assets as well as the proper treatment of expenditures made after acquisition.

Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.\nThis course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nThree common themes will characterise the course: \n\nWe privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. \n\nWe seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood. \n\nWe seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. \n\nUltimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"_ehbrDx9EeWFSA6UPWxRyQ","slug":"muslim-world","name":"Constitutional Struggles in the Muslim World"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In order for coaching to be most effective, it’s important that there is strong culture of coaching and accountability which you will learn how to incorporate into your one-on-one meetings in this course. \n\nWe’ll discuss strategies in coaching great employees who are highly motivated, consistent performers, and poor performers.  \n\nWe’ll explore specific tools, such as a coaching agenda, you can employ immediately in your coaching conversations.

Specifically, you will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge. The design of the Project emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. \n\nThe goal of the Project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will include the following outputs: \n\n1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.\n2. Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.\n3. Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.\n4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.\n\nFrom the perspective of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. \n\nBy working on these tasks, you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the Project. \n\nYou are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading.

We will study and use risk-return models such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and multi-factor models to evaluate the performance of various securities and portfolios. Specifically, we will learn how to interpret and estimate regressions that provide us with both a benchmark to use for a security given its risk (determined by its beta), as well as a risk-adjusted measure of the security’s performance (measured by its alpha). Building upon this framework, market efficiency and its implications for patterns in stock returns and the asset-management industry will be discussed. Finally, the course will conclude by connecting investment finance with corporate finance by examining firm valuation techniques such as the use of market multiples and discounted cash flow analysis. The course emphasizes real-world examples and applications in Excel throughout.

This course intends to present an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience the world—from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. We’ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you’ve been playing for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds around them. We’ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature. \n\nThis class has three main goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to biological research and the scientific method. 3.

Cuando la gente intenta concertar una definición, hay una tendencia general a recurrir al modelo heroico del liderazgo, de un hombre con características especiales y en un puesto directivo que convence a otros de seguirlo hacia su visión. Este modelo es atractivo, pero limitado y obsoleto para la mayoría de los desafíos que nos importan hoy en día. El “modelo heroico” suele ser muy útil para solucionar problemas que no requieren cambios en las personas involucradas en solucionarlos, pero es menos útil o incluso factible para progresar en la solución de problemas difíciles de definir, en situaciones en que hay mucha incertidumbre, y cuando parte importante del problema son las decisiones hábitos y miedos de la propia gente (tú incluida/o) que necesita trabajar para llegar a la solución.\n \nEn este curso vamos a preguntarnos ¿qué concepción de liderazgo y qué tipo de habilidades son útiles para el complejo y cambiante mundo en el que vivimos?, ¿cómo se aprenden estas habilidades?, ¿para qué tipo de desafíos es necesario el liderazgo?, ¿qué recursos de poder y formas de autoridad hacen parte del liderazgo y cuáles no?, ¿qué riesgos tiene la práctica del liderazgo?, ¿cómo te proteges?.\n \nVamos a invitarte a que, en el espacio virtual y en tu vida real, adquieras una perspectiva potente, unas “Gafas Efectivas” para mirar el mundo complejo en el que vives, diagnosticar los desafíos que te importan y planear intervenciones para avanzar en ellos. En otras palabras, el curso te acompaña en el proceso de adueñarte de una metodología de diagnóstico e intervención, que llamamos Espiral de Liderazgo Consciente, que te va ayudar a identificar y caracterizar:\n\n1. Tus propósitos\n2. Los desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentas para llegar a ellos\n3. Los aspectos técnicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades, que tienen que ver con reglas, dinero, conocimiento, expertos y autoridades formales\n4. Los aspectos humanos y sistémicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades: que tienen que ver con las personas interesadas y afectadas, sus valores, miedos, las facciones que forman y a veces pelean entre sí, la probabilidad de que sean aliados o detractores\n5. Tus recursos formales e informales (y desafíos internos) que afectan el tema que quieres avanzar, y los riesgos del liderazgo que probablemente enfrentarás\n\nTodo ello para que planees intervenciones y experimentos de avance, y reflexiones sobre cómo protegerte (pensando en el sistema, haciendo alianzas, reflexionando en la acción, escuchando a las facciones, gestionando tus emociones, etc)\n \nVamos a invitarte también a observar y profundizar tu habilidad para estar presente y para reflexionar y aprender antes, durante y después de hacer alguna intervención dirigida a mejorar tus resultados personales o de grupo. En otras palabras, vamos a acompañarte a profundizar en tres herramientas que llamamos “Estoy Aquí”;  “Subir al Balcón” y “Parada para respirar” que tienen que ver con meta-observar al mundo, a ti mismo en el mundo y a tu mundo interior y encontrar la respuesta a preguntas como: ¿cómo te sientes cuando estás intensamente presente en una actividad (o en un sistema en el que quieres intervenir para cambiar los resultados)?, ¿cuáles son los mecanismos por los que se dispersa tu atención y las justificaciones que te das a ti mismo para dejar de estar presente?, ¿qué está pasando en el mundo externo?, ¿qué está pasando en tu interior?.\n \nEstos objetivos de aprendizaje implican que el curso al que vas a entrar no está diseñado de forma convencional, como clases magistrales en las que un experto te “enseña” conceptos, sino que el rol de los profesores en este curso es el de diseñar oportunidades de aprendizaje para ti, y acompañarte a que reflexiones sobre ellas.\n \n\"Estilos de Liderazgo: Opciones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos\" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/estilos-liderazgo/home/welcome) es el primero de cuatro cursos que componen el programa especializado en \"Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo XXI\" (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/liderazgo-efectivo).

Es especialmente útil para personas en mandos medios y altos en organizaciones públicas, privadas y no gubernamentales (ONGs). También para líderes comunitarios, activistas y en general gente que trabaja con personas y que necesita desarrollar o profundizar habilidades y herramientas para crear, a partir de grupos con opiniones e intereses diversos comunidades que trabajan juntas para avanzar en los temas que les importan.

As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. \n\nWhile the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, in 50 years it accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize. The EU remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history.\n\nGiven its inherent complexities, this Course aims at empowering you on what Europe can offer and will enable you to discover jobs and opportunities you were not aware of. Indeed, throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You will also be able to interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"hSFk2864EeS_ZiIACzuJog","slug":"europe","name":"Understanding Europe: Why It Matters and What It Can Offer You"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course 'Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark side of the force' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness.\n\nThe goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.\n\nWhenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context.\n\nA better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.\n\nAt the end of the course, you are able to:\n\n1.    Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy) \n2.    Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades \n3.    Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context \n4.    Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization \n\n\nRecommended Background\n\nNo background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).\n\nWhy is this course important for me? \n\nCurrently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life!\n\nWhat do I need to follow this course? \n\nWe build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions. After all, we are all experts in making decisions—some more ethically, some less ethically—aren’t we?","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"psychology","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"id":"A9Yb1uFoEeWLHw5Kc9wFbw","slug":"unethical-decision-making","name":"Unethical Decision Making in Organizations"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"An introduction to physics in the context of everyday objects.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"physics-and-astronomy"}],"id":"5TWYj6aKEeSKZCIACymNCQ","slug":"how-things-work","name":"How Things Work: An Introduction to Physics"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course you will learn how to create models for decision making.

Issues of race and ethnicity are examined across different ethno-cultural traditions in order to interweave diverse experiences into a larger synthesis of the meaning of race and ethnicity in American life. In this course, we conceive of “race” and “diversity” as references to the entire American population, even as we recognize that different groups have unique historical experiences resulting in distinctive and even fundamental cultural differences.

How does it differ from science, religion, and other modes of human discourse?  This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.

Students will be able to compose music in digital audio workstation software using both audio and symbolic representations; to write code to algorithmically generate music, analyze sound, and design sound; and to describe the essential theory and history behind these activities as well as their connection to cutting-edge computer music research. Through the exploration of topics such as acoustics, psychoacoustics, digital sound, digital signal processing, audio synthesis, spectral analysis, algorithmic composition, and music information retrieval, we will explore the deep relationships between art and science, between theory and practice, and between experimental and popular electronic music.\n\nWe will learn about these topics in the context of digital audio workstation (DAW) software, the multi-track editing paradigm that has been dominant in music production since the 1980s. As we learn about the foundations behind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create music with it, and we will also write a series of short software programs that extend the software’s ability to manipulate, transform, and analyze sound.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"name":"Survey of Music Technology","id":"wIj8XHHLEeSXYyIACw0Peg","slug":"music-technology"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Ce cours propose une introduction au champ interdisciplinaire des études sur le genre, qui depuis 40 ans sont devenues un outil incontournable des sciences sociales. En proposant pour la première fois une initiation en langue française, il s’agit de faire connaître l’apport des études genre aux sciences sociales et plus généralement de faire œuvre citoyenne, en sensibilisant les participant.e.s et les étudiant.e.s aux inégalités sociales entre les hommes et les femmes et aux formes de discriminations directes ou indirectes qui les concernent dans leur diversité. Le cours utilise différentes théories et matériaux empiriques et s’inscrit dans une perspective interdisciplinaire en mobilisant l’histoire, la sociologie, l’anthropologie et les sciences politiques. Il valorise une lecture transversale et approfondie de phénomènes contemporains complexes, telle que la question des différences et des identités sexuelles, celle des inégalités à l’échelle locale et globale et celle de l’intersection des rapports de pouvoir. En mobilisant les travaux consacrés à ce qu’on appelle « l’intersectionalité », c’est-à-dire la combinaison des divers clivages sociaux et rapports de pouvoir, il met en effet l’accent sur les processus qui participent de la fabrication des différences (qu’elles soient liées au genre, à la classe, à la “race”, à la sexualité, à la religion) et analyse leurs interconnexions. A l'aide d’exemples variés tirés de recherches disponibles en français et en anglais, de media, d’enquêtes ou d’archives, il cherche à comprendre et expliquer dans leurs contextes spécifiques, les multiples ressorts des logiques de genre qui structurent les sociétés contemporaines.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"Xr4n5w7WEeeiThJuAhkCcA","slug":"genre","name":"Genre : quels enjeux ?

In addition, as the programs you develop in this course become more complex, we’ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.\n\nThe backbone project in this course will be a route planning application.  You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.  And as usual we have our different video series to help tie the content back to its importance in the real world and to provide tiered levels of support to meet your personal needs.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"algorithms","domainId":"computer-science"},{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"software-development"}],"id":"NwQ9txnoEeWDtQoum3sFeQ","slug":"advanced-data-structures","name":"Advanced Data Structures in Java"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Наглядно – интересно – просто – понятно!\nДанный курс представляет собой серию физических опытов, наглядно демонстрирующих работу основных законов механики.

Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions?

Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism – rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based – the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price “rations” the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand. \n\nAfter this course, you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve.\n•\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve.\n•\tExplain equilibrium in a market.\n•\tExplain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium.\n•\tExplain elasticity of demand.\n•\tDescribe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Rather than being seen as mystical practices from ancient Buddhism or esoteric philosophy, they are increasingly seen as technologies rooted in evidence from psychology and neuroscience.  Mindfulness has become the basis for numerous therapeutic interventions, both as a treatment in healthcare and as a means of enhancing well-being and happiness.  For millions around the world, mindfulness has become a life-style choice, enhancing and enriching everyday experience. Mindfulness is big business.\n\nBut, what actually is mindfulness?  Is it really good for you?  Can anyone learn it?  How can you recognize charlatans? Would you want to live in a mindful society, and would it smell like sandalwood?  What does it feel like to be mindful?  Are you mindful already, and how would you know?\n\nEvolving from the popular Honours Academy course at Leiden University, this innovative course combines conventional scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from psychology, through philosophy, to politics) with experiential learning (including specially designed ‘meditation labs,’ in which you’ll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness on yourself).  In the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive, and inclusive education about (and in) mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon.\n\nDuring the production of this course, we have been supported by Willem Kuyken, Director of the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre, and Stephen Batchelor, co-founder of Bodhi College.

This information establishes a knowledge foundation so that when we explore some of the most critical topics, like renewable energy, smart grid, battery storage, and you can think about it from a much more analytical and critical viewpoint. \n\nYOU WILL DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR MAKING SENSE OF THIS INDUSTRY THAT WILL BENEFIT YOU BEYOND THIS COURSE. This industry can get pretty complicated, and this course will help you make more sense of it. Electric Utilities Fundamentals and Future is the course for you whether you’re just curious about the industry or an industry veteran looking to grow – or, thinking about joining the industry. (Hint: now is a good time. You'll learn why in this course.)  No prior education or experience required. You just need a healthy curiosity and an open mind to learn about an industry that I think a lot of us, including myself sometimes, take for granted.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"environmental-science-and-sustainability"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"id":"THN_21NHEeaE6xJd9n6tpQ","slug":"electric-utilities","name":"Electric Utilities Fundamentals and Future"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"This course provides a more in-depth look at the roles and responsibilities of boards of directors in the governance of nonprofit organizations. While the course has been developed with North American culture in mind, we do appreciate that in other parts of the world, the nature of the roles and responsibilities of boards of directors may not be the same.

What is strategic planning and what can boards do to carry this out effectively? \n\nWeek 2: This week's questions: What is the board's role in assessing the performance of the organization? Why is performance assessment important? Why do many boards have difficulty meeting their performance assessment responsibilities? \n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What are the elements of the fundraising/resource development process? What is the board's role in ensuring the organization has adequate funding? What information should be in a resource development plan? \n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"-O2O1Sy8EeWV6Q7jN0iEaQ","slug":"nonprofit-gov-2","name":"The Roles and Responsibilities of Nonprofit Boards of Directors within the Governance Process"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Before you can work with data you have to get some.

Ya sea como madres, padres, cuidadores, profesores, profesionales de la salud, interesados en los medios de comunicación o en el tema de la sexualidad, con frecuencia nos planteamos preguntas como las siguientes: ¿Para qué educar sobre sexualidad, si existe abundante información al respecto? ¿La educación de la sexualidad debería brindarla la familia o la escuela? ¿A qué edad es adecuado iniciar la educación de la sexualidad? ¿La educación de la sexualidad aumenta la curiosidad sobre este tema? Para responder estos y otros interrogantes planteados por quienes participan en nuestras iniciativas de investigación y en los diferentes procesos educativos que llevamos a cabo, hemos diseñado este segundo curso con respecto a la educación de la sexualidad en diferentes ámbitos. De esta manera también queremos responder a las solicitudes de quienes ya tomaron nuestro primer Curso “Sexualidad… mucho más que sexo” de facilitar el acceso a otros cursos que profundicen en este tema. \n \nSi decides realizar este curso, esperamos que al final puedas reconocer claramente qué significa educar en el campo de la sexualidad así como identificar en qué contextos y en qué momentos ocurre esta labor.

All of this threatens the ideal of an open society in which each of us can be free and participate equally. A solid protection of human rights is needed for an open society to exist and to flourish. But it is often an uphill battle to work towards that ideal. Equip yourself and learn more about what human rights are and how they work. \n\nIn this course, we will introduce you to one of the world’s most intricate human rights systems: the European Convention on Human Rights. You will see when and how people can turn to the European Court of Human Rights to complain about human rights violations. You will learn how the Court tries to solve many of the difficult human rights dilemmas of today. We will look, amongst other things, at the freedom of expression and demonstration, the right to vote, and the prohibition of discrimination. And we will address the rights of migrants, refugees, and other vulnerable groups. And, of course, we will see whether it is possible to restrict rights and if so under what conditions.

While we will examine the behavior of individual in depth in this course, we also recognize by way of the Ecological Model that individual behavior is encouraged or constrained by the behavior of families, social groups, communities, organizations and policy makers. We recognize that behavior change is not a simplistic process but requires an understanding of dimensions like frequency, complexity and cultural congruity. Such behavioral analysis is strengthened through the use of a toolkit of theoretical models and practical frameworks. While many of such models and frameworks exist, in this course we will review the Health Belief Model, Social Learning Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, the Trans-Theoretical Model and the PRECEDE Framework. After building your behavioral analysis toolkit with these examples, you will see that actual behavior change program planning uses a combination of ideas and variables from different models, theories and frameworks.

It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"}],"id":"BySMWm04EeW8nRIpKnwp7Q","slug":"business-planning","name":"Planning: Principled, Proposing, Proofing, and Practicing to a Success Plan"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Al completar el curso, los participantes podrán: \n\na) Analizar los elementos, las estructuras, los métodos y los sistemas de costeo propios de una empresa, utilizando diversas herramientas, para identificar los posibles tipos de cálculos a generar.\n\nb) Calcular costos, utilizando diversos procedimientos acordes a los tipos de objetos de costos, estructuras, procesos y sistemas, con el propósito de obtener información relevante para la empresa que permitan una adecuada toma de decisiones.\n\nc) Elaborar e interpretar informes de costeos de objetos del costo, basándose en la información recabada y los datos obtenidos, con la finalidad de proponer diversas recomendaciones que permitan efectivas toma de decisiones.\n\n\nEn el presente curso se espera que los participantes adquieran conocimientos relacionados con Contabilidad de Costos y su rol como herramienta de apoyo a la Dirección de Empresas, distinguiendo claramente los métodos de costeo y su aplicación a los sistemas de costos.

It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.\n\nTo investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki\n\nThe 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"algorithms","domainId":"computer-science"},{"domainId":"life-sciences","subdomainId":"bioinformatics"}],"id":"d0Vop3l1EeW3pg6oA-kqJQ","slug":"assembling-genomes","name":"Genome Assembly Programming Challenge"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Ce cours vous permettra d’identifier et d’évaluer des opportunités de création d’entreprises technologiques et d’en comprendre les principaux enjeux humains, techniques, commerciaux, environnementaux et financiers.\n\nVous aurez ainsi des bases solides pour créer votre entreprise high tech ou décider d'en rejoindre une.\n\nDécider de créer ou de rejoindre une entreprise technologique dans ses premières années est la promesse d’une aventure hors du commun mais ce n’est pas un acte anodin : il faut être capable d’accepter que toutes les « bonnes » idées ne conduiront pas au succès, que seule une minorité de projets débouchera sur un immense succès.

The Three Pillar model in this course expands this model by adding strategy in place of economics.  With this change, the model becomes a practical framework that you can use to make all types of decisions—business, leadership and personal.\n\nThis course uses business decision making to show you how to use the model.  In essence, to achieve business and career success, you must manage risk (the Law Pillar) and create value (the Strategy Pillar) in a responsible manner (the Ethics Pillar).\n\nBecause the Law Pillar is especially important and challenging, the course provides legal briefings (with many examples) on the key elements of business success, such as (1) attracting the best employees, (2) developing successful products, (3) creating new business models, (4) protecting intellectual property, (5) creating contracts that achieve business goals, and (6) using dispute resolution processes that improve business relationships. \n\nIn taking a global perspective in covering these elements, the course provides an introduction to the global business culture to learners from the United States, and an introduction to the US business culture to learners from outside the US. \n\nWith this background on the Law Pillar, after completing this course you should be able to:\n\n- Manage the key risks you face in business.\n- Create value for your business by linking the Law Pillar to the Strategy Pillar.\n- Use the Ethics Pillar to become a leader in creating or managing a business that serves the interests of society while creating profits for its shareholders.\n\nAfter you master the Three Pillar model for business decisions, you can easily apply the model to your personal decisions and to leadership decisions in non-business settings.\n\nHow to successfully complete this course (4 steps):\n\n(1) Watch the short videos for each module.  The videos are interactive and include questions to test your understanding of the Three Pillars model.  You can watch them week-by-week or you can binge watch them.  Someone who binge-watched my first MOOC (“Successful Negotiation:  Essential Strategies and Skills”) concluded “It’s as good as ‘Breaking Bad.’”\n\n(2) Do the readings.  The readings are short and designed to help you use the Three Pillar model in making everyday business decisions.  They reinforce the videos and add additional coverage. \n\n(3) “Show what you know” by taking the practice quizzes at the end of each module.\n\n(4) Take the final examination.  The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.   \n\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate through the verification of your identity and successful completion of the course.  A Certificate provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Michigan logo.  If you're considering getting a Course Certificate, you should complete the verification process before taking the Final Exam. You can choose to pay the associated fee before or after the exam.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"},{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"id":"3Mf1LkHGEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ","slug":"strategy-law-ethics","name":"The Three Pillar Model for Business Decisions: Strategy, Law & Ethics"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Pricing is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions.

The industrialisation was based on forced labour, and collectivisation on repression, but both helped to create the material base for the Soviet defence industry. In the late 1930s Stalin unleashed mass terror against the Soviet people, in which millions perished. In his view this helped to rid the country of any potential internal enemies on the eve of the coming war.  \n\nThe USSR, together with its allies, won the Second World War, but at the cost of dozens of millions of lives. Stalin was instrumental in creating the post-war order. The system which he created in the 1930s shaped the USSR as it was during his lifetime and for decades after his death. It also influenced the lives of millions of people beyond the Soviet borders. \n\nThe course will enable those who take it to develop an informed understanding of the Stalin era and of the phenomenon of Stalinism.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"id":"AN3Z_CNZEee20hKGBTMJdA","slug":"stalinism","name":"Stalin and Stalinism in Russian History"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Course 2: Getting Started with Essay Writing\n\nThis is the second course in the Academic English: Writing specialization.

The Institute has seen the Cycle work in performing and presenting organizations, as well as museums, arts schools, and other nonprofit endeavors like service organizations, historical societies, public libraries, university programs, advocacy organizations, botanical gardens, and zoos.\n\nBy taking this course, you will learn: \n\n• the importance of bold, exciting, and mission-driven programming in an organization; \n• how long-term artistic planning can help an organization produce this work; \n• how an organization can aggressively market that programming and the institution behind it to develop a family of supporters - including ticket buyers, board members, donors, trustees and volunteers; \n• how an organization can cultivate and steward this family to build a healthy base of earned and contributed income; and \n• how an organization can reinvest that income into increasingly ambitious programming year after year.\n\nAll course material is available upon enrollment for self-paced learners.

We will explore current practice by talking to leading industry experts, as well as looking into interesting new research that might shape the cloud network’s future.\n\nThis course will allow us to explore in-depth the challenges for cloud networking—how do we build a network infrastructure that provides the agility to deploy virtual networks on a shared infrastructure, that enables both efficient transfer of big data and low latency communication, and that enables applications to be federated across countries and continents? Examining how these objectives are met will set the stage for the rest of the course.\n\nThis course places an emphasis on both operations and design rationale—i.e., how things work and why they were designed this way. We're excited to start the course with you and take a look inside what has become the critical communications infrastructure for many applications today.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"computer-security-and-networks"}],"id":"BpXc5-SWEeWThQoLOXqDhw","slug":"cloud-networking","name":"Cloud Networking"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Archaeology is, among human sciences, the discipline with the strongest importance for the rediscovery, but also for the preservation and protection of cultural heritage, as Humankind’s universal patrimony. You will be introduced to the way we ourselves reflect on and are engaged with the study of human past: from the practical and material recovery of ancient traces in the field to the study and interpretation. On the other hand, the discovery of human past implies the correct conservation and presentation for both experts and general public: the study and protection of the past we share every day prevent from any possible destruction, misuse, abuse and thus cancellation of human memory.\n“Recovering the Humankind's Past and Saving the Universal Heritage” presents to a large public Archaeology as a historical discipline: through an inter-disciplinary perspective you will follow the evolution and change of archaeology to the moment when natural sciences contributed to make the historical reconstructions scientifically sound; the aid of informatics and of virtual reconstructions gives new fascination to the already strong suggestion of Archaeology, as the discipline of discovery par excellence. Within this frame, Ebla, which is the glory of the Sapienza school of Oriental archaeology, will have an exemplary meaning in the course development as a long lasting experience on the field and an excellent example of the scientific results of combined researches and disciplines.\n\nMoreover, the course will focus on actual, innovative instruments to preserve, monitor and give value to cultural heritage through a multidisciplinary approach, based on a deep archaeological and historical knowledge but also on ICT technologies. The wide adoption of ICT technologies in our daily life is also impacting in the way in which we interact with our cultural heritage in particular in terms of preservation and dissemination of cultural objects.\n\nIn this course you will  learn the basic techniques  to digitize cultural objects and obtain 3D digital copies of a physical objects such as statues, vases or archaeological sites.  We will also discuss how to structure the raw data in order to facilitate and make effective the access to digital contents. In particular, we will present the European Data Model, a framework for collecting, connecting and enriching data on cultural objects provided by a number of museum, archives, sites and libraries in Europe.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"name":"Recovering the Humankind's Past and Saving the Universal Heritage","id":"7dBeI8uGEeWoOwoxwyRjgQ","slug":"preserving-cultural-heritage"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Do you have a desire to write a novel, write a screenplay, design a video game? In this project-centered course you will develop your own, original, intellectual property (IP) into a transmedia project containing written versions of your IP on various platforms. You will begin your novel, adapt the first chapters of your novel into the opening scenes of a film or TV show and create a game design concept of your IP.\n\nThis is a course is based in \"Active Learning\" so that most of the actual learning takes place within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\nI am a proponent of experiential learning (also known as active learning). My lectures are short and succinct, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a writer. I will guide you, I will show you how to get there, hopefully I will inspire you, but I won’t show you how to write or what to write. That is up to you, you are the only one who can illustrate your creative thoughts, by writing them! I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write. You need to unleash your creativity and my plan is to help you to do exactly that!\n\nAll of the assignments on this course are peer review. At each stage of the process, whether creating your novel, your screenplay or your video game, you will post your written work and review the works of your peers.  Peer review is an extremely important element of this course. Giving feedback and getting feedback is essential to the development of your critical thinking and your growth as a writer. It is as important as the writing itself.\n\nThis course is designed to tap into your creativity and help you to develop your skills in expressing that creativity through written words.\n\nWriting is a truly beautiful, amazing, satisfying thing. Imagine, putting your own words on a page to tell a story which enters your readers minds and allows them to share the thoughts, emotions and lives of your characters. It is a very rewarding experience.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"id":"wIiu6ShLEeabkA6A3tuC4Q","slug":"transmedia-writing","name":"Transmedia Writing"},{"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"When John F. Kennedy entered the presidential limousine at Love Field in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, he began his ride into history. That journey continues even today and we call it the Kennedy legacy. \n\nThis course will explore the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Students will learn how JFK’s life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.\n\nUnderstanding the Kennedy legacy and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics helps understand many of the vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.    \n    \nNovember 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy’s words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy’s influence persist, and will it continue? What are the effects? \n\nWe’ll address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century. \n\nFollow on Twitter: @JFKclass.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"id":"lf2q-R6UEeSzvSIAC0KYCQ","slug":"kennedy","name":"The Kennedy Half Century"}],"paging":{"total":2334},"linked":{}}
